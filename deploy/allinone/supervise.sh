# 1. migrations: `migrate up` once, before anything serves, under a
#    non-blocking advisory lock (see migrate_locked for why not migrate's own).
# 2. starts api, web and (GATEWAY=on) the gateway: api/deploy/gateway's own
#    entrypoint.sh + Caddyfile, upstreams pointed at 127.0.0.1; every output
#    line is prefixed [api] / [web] / [gateway] on stdout/stderr.
# 3. fail-fast: when ANY child exits, the others are stopped and the container
#    exits with that child's code, so Docker/Kubernetes restart policy restarts
#    the unit. (Deliberately no in-container restart loop: a half-running
#    appliance that reports healthy is worse than a restart.)
# 4. SIGTERM/SIGINT: forwarded to all children, then waited for (graceful).
