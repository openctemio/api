# Which areas did this event touch? Writes to $GITHUB_OUTPUT:
#   api=true|false   the Go API (api/) or a shared file
#   web=true|false   the web app (web/), the API spec it is generated from,
#                    the router its endpoint check's route manifest is
#                    generated from, or a shared file
# The ONE place the routing rules live: every workflow's `changes` job calls
# this and reads the output it needs, so the rules cannot drift apart.
#
# Shared files run both sides: the root Makefile, go.work, anything under
# .github/ (workflows, these scripts, Dependabot, CODEOWNERS) and deploy/ (the
# all-in-one image, which embeds both components).
#
# Why the required-check workflows do not use `on.<event>.paths`: a workflow
# skipped by a paths filter leaves its required checks "Pending" forever and
# blocks the merge. A JOB skipped by `if:` reports Success. So those workflows
# always start, and this decides which jobs run. Workflows with no required
# check (api-security.yml, web-security.yml) use `paths:` directly and do not
# start at all for the other side.
#
# PR: diff against the base branch. Push: before..HEAD. Merge queue
# (merge_group): merge_group.base_sha..head_sha, i.e. only the queued PR.
# Anything else (schedule, dispatch, tag, first push of a branch, missing
# SHAs) runs everything: when in doubt, run.
