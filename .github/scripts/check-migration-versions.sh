# Guards golang-migrate version numbers in api/migrations (NNNNNN_name.{up,down}.sql):
#
#   1. No two migrations share a version. Two PRs written in parallel both
#      take "max+1"; once both merge, golang-migrate refuses to start on the
#      duplicate.
#   2. With a base commit: every migration this change ADDS must have a version
#      above the highest version already on the base. golang-migrate only
#      applies versions above a database's current one, so a lower number
#      merged later is silently skipped on every already-migrated database.
#
# Base commit: the PR's base branch on pull_request, merge_group.base_sha in the
# merge queue (so a queued PR is re-checked against what is actually ahead of
# it), none on push (only check 1). Run from the repository root.
