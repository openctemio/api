## 1. Authentication

### 1.1 Dual-Token Strategy

| Token              | Storage                     | Lifetime                            | Access           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Access Token (JWT) | In-memory via Zustand store | ~15 min (from backend `expires_in`) | JavaScript only  |
| Refresh Token      | httpOnly secure cookie      | 7 days (`COOKIE_MAX_AGE`)           | Server-side only |

**Key implementation details** (`src/stores/auth-store.ts`):

- Access token stored exclusively in Zustand state. Never persisted to cookies, localStorage, or sessionStorage.
- JWT decoded client-side via `atob()` to extract user claims (`sub`, `email`, `permissions`, `tenant_id`, `tenant_role`). **No signature verification on client** -- verification is done server-side at the backend API.
- Zustand devtools disabled in production (`enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`).

### 1.2 Token Refresh

- Auto-refresh triggers `TOKEN_REFRESH_BEFORE_EXPIRY` seconds before expiration (default: 300s = 5 minutes).
- Calls `POST /api/auth/refresh` with `credentials: 'include'` (sends httpOnly cookie).
- **Mutex-protected**: `isRefreshingToken` flag prevents concurrent refresh attempts.
- **Permanent failure flag**: `authPermanentlyFailed` prevents infinite refresh loops. On failure, clears all auth state and redirects to login.
- Token size monitored: logs warning when JWT approaches 4KB cookie limit.

### 1.3 Same-Origin API Proxy

All client-side API requests go through the Next.js API proxy route (`src/app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts`), not directly to the backend:

1. Browser sends request to `/api/v1/*` (same-origin, cookie sent automatically).
2. Proxy reads `auth_token` from httpOnly cookie.
3. Proxy forwards request to backend with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
4. If 401: proxy auto-refreshes token and retries once.
5. Response returned to browser without exposing the token.

**Benefits**: Eliminates CORS issues, tokens never appear in client JavaScript for API calls, backend URL hidden from browser.

### 1.4 Cookie Configuration

All auth cookies are set with:

```
httpOnly: true
secure: true (when NODE_ENV === 'production')
sameSite: 'lax'
path: '/'
```

**Complete cookie inventory:**

| Cookie                | httpOnly | Sensitive | Purpose                                          |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `auth_token`          | Yes      | Yes       | JWT access token                                 |
| `refresh_token`       | Yes      | Yes       | Refresh token                                    |
| `oauth_state`         | Yes      | Yes       | OAuth CSRF state parameter                       |
| `oauth_redirect`      | Yes      | No        | Post-OAuth redirect URL                          |
| `csrf_token`          | No       | No        | CSRF double-submit token (JS-readable by design) |
| `app_tenant`          | No       | No        | Current tenant info (display only)               |
| `app_user_info`       | No       | No        | User info for onboarding (5-min TTL)             |
| `app_pending_tenants` | No       | No        | Multi-tenant selection (5-min TTL)               |
| `locale`              | No       | No        | Language preference                              |
| `theme`               | No       | No        | Theme preference                                 |

### 1.5 Login Flow

1. User submits credentials to Server Action (`loginAction`).
2. Server Action calls backend `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
3. Backend returns `refresh_token` + list of tenant memberships.
4. If single tenant: exchanges refresh token for tenant-scoped access token via `POST /api/v1/auth/token`.
5. If multiple tenants: stores tenant list in non-httpOnly cookie for selection UI.
6. If zero tenants: redirects to team creation onboarding.
7. Access token returned in response body (stored in Zustand), refresh token set as httpOnly cookie.

### 1.6 Logout

`logoutAction()` clears ALL auth cookies (`auth_token`, `refresh_token`, `app_tenant`, `app_user_info`, `app_pending_tenants`) and redirects to `/login`.

### 1.7 OAuth (Social Login)

- Supported providers: Google, GitHub, Microsoft.
- **CSRF protection**: Random `state` parameter stored in httpOnly `oauth_state` cookie, validated on callback.
- Token flow follows same httpOnly cookie pattern as local auth.

### 1.8 Email Enumeration Prevention

`forgotPasswordAction()` always returns `{ success: true }` regardless of whether the email exists in the system.

---

## 2. Authorization (RBAC)

### 2.1 Permission Model

- 150+ permissions defined in `src/lib/permissions/constants.ts`.
- Hierarchical format: `{module}:{subfeature}:{action}` (e.g., `assets:groups:write`).
- **Permissions are the source of truth from the API** -- no client-side bypass for Owner/Admin roles.

### 2.2 Real-Time Permission Sync

The `PermissionProvider` (`src/context/permission-provider.tsx`) keeps permissions in sync:

| Trigger                     | Condition                    | Behavior                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Initial load                | Always                       | Fetch from `/api/v1/me/permissions/sync` |
| `X-Permission-Stale` header | API response includes header | Immediate refetch                        |
| 403 Forbidden               | API returns 403              | Immediate refetch                        |
| Tab focus                   | Tab hidden > 30 seconds      | Refetch                                  |
| Polling                     | Every 2 minutes              | Refetch if stale                         |

- **Debounce**: Minimum 5 seconds between API calls.
- **ETag support**: Conditional `If-None-Match` requests to reduce bandwidth.
- **localStorage cache**: Permissions cached for instant UI render on page reload. Cleared on logout via `clearAllStoredPermissions()`.

### 2.3 UI Permission Gating

```tsx
// Hide element if user lacks permission
<Can permission="assets:write">
  <EditButton />
</Can>

// Show disabled element with tooltip
<Can permission="assets:delete" behavior="disable">
  <DeleteButton />
</Can>
```

### 2.4 Multi-Tenant Isolation

- JWT contains `tenant_id` claim scoping all API requests.
- Backend enforces `WHERE tenant_id = ?` on all data queries.
- Permission cache keys include tenant ID to prevent cross-tenant data leaks.
- Team switching exchanges tokens via `POST /api/auth/switch-team`.

---

## 3. Route Protection

### 3.1 Default-Deny Model

`src/proxy.ts` runs `decideAuth()` from `src/lib/middleware/auth.ts` on every page
request (the matcher skips `/api/*`, `/_next/*` and static files):

- **Every page requires the tenant session by default.**
- Public pages (`PUBLIC_ROUTES` in `src/lib/middleware/config.ts`, matched on a
  path-segment boundary): `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`,
  `/reset-password`, `/set-password`, `/invitations/*`, `/verify-email`,
  `/auth/callback/*`, `/auth/sso/callback/*`, `/auth/error`, `/admin/login/*`, and
  the `/icon` metadata routes.
- No session: `307` to `/login?next=<page>`; the tenant-selection cookies (and a
  malformed token cookie) are expired on that response.
- The platform admin console (`/admin/*`, RFC-022) has its own rule: without the
  console's `admin_csrf` cookie (issued and cleared with the `admin_session`
  cookie, which is scoped to `/api/v1/admin` and so never reaches a page), `307`
  to `/admin/login?next=<page>`.
- API routes (`/api/*`) authenticate each call themselves.

### 3.2 Open Redirect Prevention

The proxy builds `next` from the request's own path through `safeInternalHref()`
(`src/lib/safe-href.ts`): only a same-origin path, never `//host`, `/\host`, or
a path with control or bidi characters. `/login` validates `next`, `redirect` and
`returnTo` again with `validateRedirectUrl()`.

### 3.3 Authentication Check and Stale Cookies

The proxy checks that a session cookie (`auth_token` or `refresh_token`) is
**present and shaped like a JWT**, nothing more: no signature or expiry check,
no network call. The API verifies the token on every call.

A stale cookie (expired, revoked, signed with a rotated key) therefore passes
the proxy. The page's first API call gets `401`, the refresh fails, and the
client calls `endSessionAndSignIn()` (`src/stores/auth-store.ts`) once: it drops
the team cookies, runs the sign-out server action (which expires the httpOnly
token cookies) and lands on `/login?redirect=<page>`. The proxy never redirects
a request that has a session-shaped cookie and never redirects away from
`/login`, and `/login` uses the same `hasSessionCookie()` check, so the two
cannot bounce the browser between them.

### 3.4 Locale

The proxy picks the locale from the `locale` cookie (the user's choice in the
language switcher), then `Accept-Language` as a default, among the locales
with a shipped catalog (`supportedLocales` in `src/lib/i18n.ts`, currently
`en` and `vi`), and passes it as `x-locale`. The root layout validates it
again. No right-to-left locale ships yet, so the page is always `dir="ltr"`.

---

## 4. Security Headers

Configured in `next.config.ts`, applied to all routes via `/:path*`:

### 4.1 Response Headers

| Header                   | Value                                      | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `X-Frame-Options`        | `DENY`                                     | Prevents clickjacking       |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff`                                  | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| `Referrer-Policy`        | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`          | Limits referrer leakage     |
| `Permissions-Policy`     | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` | Restricts browser APIs      |

### 4.2 Content Security Policy

Set per request by `src/proxy.ts` (built in `src/lib/middleware/csp.ts`) with a
fresh 128-bit script nonce. Next.js reads the nonce from the request's policy
and stamps it on its own scripts; the root layout passes it to next-themes.
Every page is rendered per request (the root layout reads `headers()`), so no
static HTML carries a stale nonce.

| Directive         | Value                                                     | Notes                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default-src`     | `'self'`                                                  | Baseline restriction                                           |
| `script-src`      | `'self' 'nonce-<per request>' 'strict-dynamic'`           | No `'unsafe-inline'`; `'unsafe-eval'` added only by `next dev` |
| `style-src`       | `'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com`     | Tailwind, React `style={}`, Radix, sonner                      |
| `style-src-elem`  | `'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com`     | Google Fonts stylesheets                                       |
| `img-src`         | `'self' data: https:`                                     | Tool logos and SCM avatars from arbitrary hosts                |
| `font-src`        | `'self' data: https://fonts.gstatic.com`                  | Google Fonts files                                             |
| `connect-src`     | `'self'` + origins from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / WS config | API + WebSocket connections                                    |
| `object-src`      | `'none'`                                                  | No plugins                                                     |
| `frame-src`       | `'none'`                                                  | The app embeds no frames                                       |
| `frame-ancestors` | `'none'`                                                  | Double protection with X-Frame-Options                         |
| `base-uri`        | `'self'`                                                  | Prevents base tag injection                                    |
| `form-action`     | `'self'`                                                  | Restricts form submission targets                              |

**Known trade-offs:**

- `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`: inline `style` attributes cannot carry a nonce. CSS cannot run script.
- `img-src https:` allows images from any HTTPS source (tool logos, SCM avatars). Narrowing it needs an image proxy. The URLs go through `safeImageSrc` (section 4.3).
- zod 4 probes `new Function('')` once to decide whether to JIT; the probe is caught and reported as a `script-src` eval violation in the console. Harmless.

### 4.3 Data-driven links and images (RFC-040)

Scanner references, evidence URIs, asset URLs, notification targets and
integration hosts are attacker-influenced (a hostile scan target or sensor).
Every data-driven `href` and `src` goes through `src/lib/safe-href.ts`:

- `<SafeExternalLink href={…}>` (`src/components/safe-external-link.tsx`) for external links: `http`/`https` and same-origin paths only, `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`; a refused URL renders as plain text.
- `safeHref(url)` where a component needs the string (Next `<Link>`, `asChild` menus); `safeImageSrc(url)` for images (adds base64 raster `data:` and same-origin `blob:`); `safeInternalHref(path)` for server-supplied in-app paths.
- Refused: `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, `blob:` and every other scheme, in any case, with embedded tabs/newlines or leading control characters, entity- or percent-encoded, protocol-relative `//host` and `/\host`, bidi/zero-width characters, over 4096 characters.
- `src/lib/__tests__/raw-href-guard.test.ts` parses every `.tsx` file and fails on an `href={…}`/`src={…}` that is not provably safe; reviewed navigation config is listed there with a reason.

## 5. WebSocket & SSE Security

### 5.1 Same-origin WebSocket, session cookie

The browser opens the socket on the UI's own origin
(`wss://<ui-host>/api/v1/ws`, `src/context/websocket-provider.tsx`) and sends
the httpOnly access-token cookie with the upgrade. No credential is put in the
URL and there is no ticket or token endpoint (the former `/auth/ws-token` and
its JWT fallback were removed, RFC-045). The API:

- authenticates the upgrade through the same tenant gates as every tenant
  route (revoked session, SSO enforcement, organization IP allowlist, active
  membership);
- requires an Origin from `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (exact match), and refuses a
  cookie-authenticated upgrade with no Origin (cross-site WebSocket hijacking);
- binds the socket to the session: it closes it with code `4401` when the
  access token expires (15 minutes at most), when the session is signed out or
  revoked, and when the user's membership or role changes.

The client reconnects with full-jitter backoff. After a `4401` it reconnects
and, if that is refused, refreshes the session once under a cross-tab lock
(`src/lib/auth-refresh-lock.ts`: the refresh token rotates and its reuse
revokes the session family), then reconnects. It reconnects when the active
organization changes.

### 5.2 Other hosts

Serving the WebSocket from another host (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_BASE_URL`) needs the
session cookie on that host (same site and a cookie `Domain`). A cross-site
host never gets the cookie and is not supported: proxy `/api/v1/ws` onto the
UI origin instead (the gateway, `server-with-ws.mjs` and `next dev` all do).

### 5.3 No token endpoint

There is no route that hands the httpOnly access token to page script. An
unused `/api/auth/sse-token` route did, which made the cookie readable by any
script on the origin; it was removed. Server-Sent Events are not used.

---

## 6. CSRF Protection

- **OAuth flows**: Protected via random `state` parameter stored in httpOnly cookie.
- **API mutations**: Protected by same-origin proxy pattern. All API calls go through `/api/v1/*` (same-origin), so browsers enforce same-origin policy automatically.
- **CSRF token (double-submit)**: The **backend** sets a `csrf_token` cookie at login with **`HttpOnly=false` on purpose** so client JS can read it (`document.cookie` in `src/lib/api/client.ts`). On every state-changing method the client re-sends that value as the `X-CSRF-Token` header; the backend rejects a missing/mismatched header with `403 csrf_token_missing_header`. Making this cookie httpOnly would break double-submit, since JS could no longer read it.
- **Note:** `generateCsrfToken()` / `setCsrfToken()` in `src/lib/cookies-server.ts` (which set an httpOnly `csrf_token`) exist but are **not wired** — they are not the client-visible double-submit token described above and have no callers.

---

## 7. Input Validation

### 7.1 Schema Validation (Zod)

All forms use Zod schemas (`src/features/*/schemas/`) for:

- Client-side validation (immediate UX feedback via React Hook Form).
- Server-side validation (Server Actions re-validate before processing).

### 7.2 Authentication Schemas

| Field            | Validation                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Email            | Non-empty + valid email format  |
| Password         | Minimum 8 characters            |
| First/Last Name  | 1-50 characters                 |
| Confirm Password | Must match password field       |
| Reset Token      | Non-empty string                |
| OAuth State      | Validated against stored cookie |

### 7.3 TypeScript Strict Mode

- `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` -- no implicit `any`, strict null checks.
- `no-explicit-any` ESLint rule enforced (except test files).

---

## 8. Environment Variables

### 8.1 Public Variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)

Baked into the client bundle at build time. Safe to expose:

| Variable                          | Default                 | Purpose                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`             | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend URL                          |

### 10.3 Pre-commit Hooks (`.githooks/` + lint-staged)

Automatically run on `git commit` when `web/` files are staged (repository root
`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled by `make hooks` or `npm ci`):

- TypeScript type checking on all staged files.
- ESLint auto-fix on staged `.ts`/`.tsx` files.
- Prettier formatting on staged files.

### 10.4 Dependency Management (Dependabot)

- Weekly updates for npm, GitHub Actions, Docker base images.
- Grouped updates: React, Next.js, testing, linting, Tailwind, Radix UI, TypeScript.
- Major versions blocked by default (security updates still allowed).
- Review assigned to `openctemio/security` team.

## 11. Development Security

### 11.1 Dev Auth Bypass

A development-only auth bypass exists in `src/lib/dev-auth.ts`:

- Enabled **only** when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`.
- Uses hardcoded dev credentials (`admin@openctem.io`).
- Sets a `dev_auth_token` cookie (non-httpOnly) accepted by the middleware.
- **Completely disabled in production** via `NODE_ENV` guard.

### 11.2 Error Message Handling

The API error handler (`src/lib/api/error-handler.ts`) maps backend errors to user-friendly messages. Backend messages shorter than 100 characters and not containing internal markers are passed through. Sensitive errors (500s, auth failures) are replaced with generic messages.

---

## 12. Secure Development Guidelines for Contributors

### Must Do

1. **Never commit secrets** -- Use `.env.local` (gitignored), not `.env`.
2. **Validate all inputs** with Zod schemas in both client and server.
3. **Use Server Components** by default to reduce client-side attack surface.
4. **Use `window.location.href`** (not `router.push`) after auth changes to ensure cookies are picked up.
5. **No `any` types** -- Use `unknown` and narrow with type guards.
6. **Run `npm run validate`** before every commit (type-check + lint + format).

### Must Not

1. **Never store tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage** -- Use Zustand store (memory only).
2. **Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** without sanitization.
3. **Never add `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix** to secret environment variables.
4. **Never bypass the API proxy** for authenticated requests (except file uploads which use XHR with in-memory token).
5. **Never hardcode credentials** outside of dev-only guarded code.

### Cookie Rules

- Sensitive cookies: Always `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` in production, `sameSite: 'lax'`.
- Client-accessible cookies: Only for non-sensitive data (locale, theme, tenant display info).
- The `authTokenCookie.set()` client-side method is deliberately blocked and logs an error.

## 13. Known Trade-offs & Hardening Roadmap

### Current Trade-offs

| Item                              | Status      | Rationale                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WebSocket token in URL query      | Accepted    | WebSocket API cannot send custom headers. Token scoped to same session via httpOnly endpoint. |
| Password policy (8 chars minimum) | Intentional | Backend enforces additional policies. Client-side strength meter provides guidance.           |
| `img-src https:` wildcard         | Accepted    | Required for user avatars and external content.                                               |

### Hardening Roadmap

- [x] Nonce-based CSP to eliminate `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` from `script-src` (RFC-040)
- [ ] Environment-conditional CSP `connect-src` (strip localhost in production)
- [ ] Upgrade CSRF token generation to `crypto.randomBytes()`
- [ ] Client-side rate limiting for login attempts (config exists at `SECURITY_CONFIG.MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS: 5` but not yet enforced)
- [ ] Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources

## 14. Compliance Targets

- OWASP Top 10 (actively addressed)
- CWE/SANS Top 25 (actively addressed)
- SOC 2 Type II (planned)
- ISO 27001 (planned)
