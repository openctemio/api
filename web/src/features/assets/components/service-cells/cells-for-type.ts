/**
 * Which service-cell facts an asset type shows, in ONE place.
 *
 * The rich service cells (status with redirect chain, IP / CNAME, technology,
 * TLS …) describe the external surface only. Repositories, cloud, k8s,
 * identities, databases and the other types keep their own typed cells;
 * the label chips and the "issues found" chip apply to every type and are
 * not listed here.
 *
 * This map is the seam for the asset-type registry (RFC-042, in design):
 * when the registry lands, it supplies the cell list per type and this
 * file becomes a lookup into it. Do not add `if (type === …)` checks for
 * these cells anywhere else.
