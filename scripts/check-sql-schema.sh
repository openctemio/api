# check-sql-schema.sh — catch Go-vs-database drift at build time.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The startup schema check (cmd/server/schema_check.go) only compares the
# migration VERSION. It cannot tell whether the columns the code actually
# references exist. That gap shipped a run of bugs that were invisible to
# `go build`, `go vet`, the linters and the unit tests, and only failed when a
# real query ran against a real database:
#
#   * pipeline runs stuck in 'running' forever  — `$2 IN (...)` deduced text
#     while the column is varchar → 42P08 on the terminal transition of every run
#   * asset stale-detection never demoted anything — code said `last_seen_at`,
#     the column is `last_seen` → 42703
#   * cancelling a pipeline run never worked — assigned `commands.updated_at`,
#     a column no migration creates → 42703
#   * the EPSS sync died on every run — a COPY staging table hardcoded in Go as
#     DECIMAL(8,6) while the real column had been widened to numeric(9,6)
#
# Every one of them would have been caught here.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# ------------
#   1. start a throwaway PostgreSQL
#   2. apply every migrations/*.up.sql in order — so the schema is exactly what
#      a fresh production deploy gets, not whatever a dev database has drifted to
#   3. extract SQL string literals from the Go sources
#   4. PREPARE each one. Postgres itself is the oracle: it resolves every table,
#      column, type and parameter without any data or fixtures.
#
# Only statements that are complete and parameter-clean can be prepared, so a
# statement assembled with fmt.Sprintf/strings.Join is skipped rather than
# guessed at — see the LIMITATIONS note at the bottom, which is honest about the
# residual gap instead of implying full coverage.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-sql-schema.sh [--keep]
# Exit:   0 = no drift, 1 = drift found, 2 = usage or environment error
# =============================================================================
# GitHub Actions invokes steps as `bash -e {0}`, so errexit is inherited even
# though this script handles every failure explicitly. Under -e the readiness
# probe below — which is SUPPOSED to fail while Postgres boots — killed the run.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The SQL above references something the migrations do not create. This is the
class of bug that compiles, lints and unit-tests clean and then fails on every
real execution — usually swallowed by a log line, so the feature just silently
never works.

Fix the query, or add the migration. Do not "fix" this by making the statement
unextractable.

LIMITATIONS (deliberately stated, so nobody reads a green tick as full cover):
statements assembled at runtime with fmt.Sprintf / strings.Join cannot be
prepared as written and are skipped. A column typo inside a dynamically built
WHERE/ORDER BY fragment will NOT be caught here — the big filter builders in
finding_repository.go, asset_repository.go and dashboard_repository.go are the
main residue.
