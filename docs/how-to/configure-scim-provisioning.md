# How to configure SCIM provisioning

Let your identity provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, …) **provision and
deprovision users** into an OpenCTEM tenant over SCIM 2.0. Deactivation in the IdP
suspends the OpenCTEM membership **immediately** (0-second offboarding).
Architecture: [scim-provisioning.md](../architecture/scim-provisioning.md).

> Roles: minting/listing/revoking SCIM tokens needs the **admin** or **owner**
> team role.

## 1. Generate a SCIM token

**Settings → Integrations → SCIM → Generate token:**

- Give it a **Name** (e.g. "Okta production") and click **Generate**.
- The full token (`oct_scim_…`) is shown **once** in the reveal dialog — copy it
  now and store it securely. It cannot be shown again (regenerate if lost).

Tokens are stored as a peppered HMAC, never in plaintext. Revoking a token (the
**Ban** action) cuts the IdP's access immediately.

## 2. Point your IdP at the SCIM endpoint

From the **SCIM endpoint** card, copy the base URL:

```
<your-origin>/scim/v2
```

In the IdP's SCIM provisioning config, set:

- **Base URL:** `<your-origin>/scim/v2`
- **Auth:** HTTP bearer — `Authorization: Bearer oct_scim_…`

The tenant is derived from the token, so **one token = one tenant** (cross-tenant
provisioning is impossible by construction). Supported: Users (`GET/POST/PUT/
PATCH/DELETE /Users`) and Groups (`/Groups`), plus discovery
(`ServiceProviderConfig`, `ResourceTypes`, `Schemas`). PATCH accepts both Okta and
Azure AD member-op styles.

## 3. Provision users (and, optionally, roles via groups)

- **Push users** from the IdP. A new user is created passwordless and added as an
  active tenant member with role **`member`** by default. Re-pushing an existing
  active member is idempotent.
- **Deactivate** (IdP `active:false` / DELETE) → the membership is suspended and
  all sessions + permission cache are cleared immediately. Reactivate to restore.
- **Group → role mapping:** a pushed group whose `displayName` matches a tenant
  role (`admin` / `member` / `viewer`, case-insensitive) maps its members to that
  role; effective role = the highest matched. `owner` is **never** assignable via
  SCIM.

> **Gotcha — group→role mapping has no UI.** Custom mappings (e.g. an IdP group
> `Acme-OpenCTEM-Admins` → `admin`) are configured **via the API only**:
> `PUT /api/v1/scim-tokens/group-mappings` with
> `{"mappings":{"Acme-OpenCTEM-Admins":"admin"}}`. Without a mapping, group members
> fall back to `member`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| IdP gets 401 | Token revoked or wrong — check it's active in the tokens table; regenerate if lost (one-time reveal). |
| New users all land as `member` | Expected unless a group→role mapping applies (API-only, above). |
| Can't set someone as owner via IdP | By design — `owner` is never SCIM-assignable. |
| Deprovisioned user still "in" | Deactivation suspends the tenant membership (immediate) but retains the global user record; that's expected. |
| PATCH returns `invalidPath` | The IdP sent an unsupported PATCH path — only standard user/group member ops are supported. |

> SCIM provisioning is separate from **SAML SSO login** (Settings → Integrations →
> SAML SSO). For Entra/OIDC login see [configure-entraid.md](./configure-entraid.md).
