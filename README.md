Open-source Continuous Threat Exposure Management platform. This repository holds
the two parts that ship together:

| Directory | What | Image |
|---|---|---|
| [`api/`](api/) | Go API server, migrations, admin CLI (module `github.com/openctemio/openctem/api`) | `ghcr.io/openctemio/openctem-api` |
| [`web/`](web/) | Next.js web console | `ghcr.io/openctemio/openctem-web` |
| [`deploy/allinone/`](deploy/allinone/) | API + web + gateway in one container (Postgres/Redis external) | `ghcr.io/openctemio/openctem` |

Released separately, in their own repositories:
[sensor](https://github.com/openctemio/sensor) (scanning agent),
[sdk-go](https://github.com/openctemio/sdk-go),
[ctis](https://github.com/openctemio/ctis) (shared contract),
[helm-charts](https://github.com/openctemio/helm-charts),
[docs](https://github.com/openctemio/docs) (public documentation).

## Repository layout & history

The monorepo was formed on 2026-10-02
([RFC-020](api/docs/rfcs/RFC-020-api-ui-monorepo.md)):

- **`openctemio/api` → this repository.** It was renamed, so its issues, pull
  requests, releases (v0.1.x–v0.8.0) and old links carry over and redirect here.
  Its Go code moved to `api/`; the module path is now
  `github.com/openctemio/openctem/api`.
- **`openctemio/ui` → `web/`.** Its full history was imported under `web/`, and
  [openctemio/ui](https://github.com/openctemio/ui) is archived (read-only); its
  old releases stay there. Cite its PRs as `openctemio/ui#NNN`: a bare `#NNN`
  means this repository.
- **`ui/vX.Y.Z` tags** are the ui repository's tags, imported for history only.
  They release nothing; only `vX.Y.Z` tags do (see [Releases](#releases)).
- **Images** moved from `ghcr.io/openctemio/api` / `ui` to `openctem-api` /
  `openctem-web`; the old names are mirrored for a transition window.
- `openctemio/agent` had already become [openctemio/sensor](https://github.com/openctemio/sensor) (RFC-023).

## Quick start (development)

```bash
make setup     # go mod download, npm ci, enable git hooks
make dev-api   # see api/README.md for Postgres/Redis
make dev-web   # http://localhost:3000
make check     # what CI runs, both components
```

## Deploying

- **Compose, one HTTPS port:** [`api/deploy/docker-compose.yml`](api/deploy/docker-compose.yml)
  runs the gateway ([`api/deploy/gateway`](api/deploy/gateway), Caddy), web, API,
  Postgres and Redis; only the gateway is published.
- **All-in-one image:** `ghcr.io/openctemio/openctem` embeds the same gateway.
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 443:443 -v openctem-data:/data \
    -e OPENCTEM_HOSTNAME=ctem.example.com -e DB_HOST=... -e DB_PASSWORD=... -e REDIS_HOST=... \
    -e AUTH_JWT_SECRET=... -e APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... ghcr.io/openctemio/openctem:vX.Y.Z
  ```
  `GATEWAY=on` (default) serves only :443 (`OPENCTEM_TLS_MODE` internal | acme |
  files | http, as in the Compose gateway); `GATEWAY=off` serves the API on :8080
  and the web on :3000 for your own proxy. `/data` keeps attachments and the
  gateway's CA: mount a volume.
- **Kubernetes:** [helm-charts](https://github.com/openctemio/helm-charts).

## Releases

One tag, `vX.Y.Z`, releases every image from the same commit: `openctem-api`,
`openctem-web`, `openctem` (all-in-one), `migrations`, `seed`, `admin-cli`, all
multi-arch (amd64, arm64), signed with cosign, with SBOMs on the release. The
pre-monorepo names `ghcr.io/openctemio/api` and `ghcr.io/openctemio/ui` keep
receiving identical copies for two releases. See
[`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml).

## The API contract

`api/api/openapi/swagger.yaml` is generated from the Go handler annotations
(`make -C api swagger`, gated by `api/scripts/check-openapi.sh`). The web wire
types in `web/src/lib/api/generated/api.types.ts` are generated from that same
file (`make api-types`), and CI fails if they differ — so a change to the API
contract and the web code that consumes it land in one pull request.
