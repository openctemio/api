# Protocol-v1 compatibility check (RFC-023 §9.2, C8).
#
# Proves that a sensor built with the LAST RELEASED sdk-go keeps working
# against this API build: connection test, heartbeat, CTIS push, command
# lifecycle, suppressions, key renewal. The sensor side lives in
# tests/compat/v1 (its own module, pinned to that SDK release); this script
# prepares a tenant, a sensor key and a queued command, runs it, and checks
# the platform recorded the outcome.
#
# The provisioning calls below use the MANAGEMENT API, which is allowed to
# change between versions; update them with it. The protocol-v1 surface the
# harness exercises is frozen and must never need changes here.
#
# Requires: a migrated database, the API running at COMPAT_API_URL, curl, jq,
# and the bootstrap-admin binary (it creates the organization the way a first
# install does). Usage:
#   COMPAT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 DATABASE_URL=postgres://... \
#   BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_BIN=./bin/bootstrap-admin scripts/compat-v1.sh
