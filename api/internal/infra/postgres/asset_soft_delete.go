// Safe asset delete (owner decision O3, migrations 000378-000380).
//
// A person's delete never destroys findings. An asset that has findings is
// refused (archive it instead); one without findings is soft-deleted:
//
//   - assets.deleted_at / deleted_by are set and every read excludes the row
//     (liveAssetSQL);
//   - the name is freed: the full (tenant_id, name) unique key stays in place
//     for pods of the previous release, so the row keeps a unique tombstone
//     name and the original goes to the audit log, letting the same name be
//     created again at once;
//   - the asset is detached from everything that would surface it or route
//     work to it: groups, owners, data scope, grants, relationships,
//     suggestions, business units and services, controls, identifiers, scan
//     coverage, its discovered services and components, pending dedup reviews,
//     and its children's parent link;
//   - its history (state history, exposures, attribution evidence) stays for
//     the retention period; PurgeDeleted then hard-deletes the row.
//
// findings.asset_id is ON DELETE NO ACTION, so even the purge (or any other
// hard delete) cannot take findings with it.
