	// This controller used to run commandRepo.ExpireOldCommands() on the same

	// never covered them at all and the raw UPDATE was the *only* thing that
	// ever reaped them. Every platform job that timed out in the queue took its
	// pipeline run down silently, and the run hung until ScanTimeoutController
	// reported a generic timeout instead of "expired in queue".
