## 1. Answer in short

Dedup in OpenCTEM is one unique index (`findings(tenant_id, fingerprint)`) fed
by five fingerprint producers that disagree, an ingest path that checks before
it writes, and an asset merge that resolves collisions by deleting rows. The
audit reproduced **20 failures** on a migrated database through the real ingest
service. The ones that lose data:

1. **An asset merge deletes the triaged copy of a finding** (risk acceptance,
   Jira link, comments, audit activities, validation evidence all cascade away).
2. **A concurrent ingest race** reports a finding as created twice, fires the
   created hooks with an id that does not exist, and the loser's
   `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` **wipes the ticket link and metadata** of the winner.
3. **Line-keyed identity** for SAST (semgrep OSS, SARIF without `fingerprints`)
   and secrets: inserting three lines above a false positive re-opens it as a new
   finding; the FP is auto-resolved and forgotten.
4. **Version-keyed SCA identity**: a still-vulnerable version bump is a new
   finding; the in-progress one, with its ticket, is auto-resolved.
5. **Cross-tool lifecycle**: a finding seen by two tools is closed by whichever
   tool misses it, and reopened by the other — flapping.
6. **Asset normalization**: `http_service` URLs are stored under garbled names
   (3 assets for one URL), two EC2 instances collapse into one asset, a host is
   absorbed into a domain of the same name.

The design in one paragraph: every deduplicated entity gets a **canonical
identity tuple** computed **only on the server**, hashed with a **versioned**
recipe whose fields are unit-separated; findings are written with **one atomic
upsert** that returns whether the row was inserted; a finding can be found by
**any of its fingerprints** (an alias table) so an algorithm change re-keys
without losing state; every observation becomes a **sighting** (ADR-004) and
lifecycle is decided per sighting; same-vulnerability-same-asset across
techniques is a **correlation group**, not a forced merge; and any merge —
finding or asset — **moves state to a survivor and tombstones the loser**
(`status = duplicate`, `duplicate_of`), never deletes it.

## 2. Problem statement

Proven failures, ordered by data-integrity risk. Probe ids refer to
[architecture/deduplication.md §5](../architecture/deduplication.md#5-how-the-evidence-was-produced).

| Id | Failure | Probe | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Asset merge: post-commit fingerprint recompute **deletes** the merged asset's finding on collision; its status (`accepted_risk`), tickets, comments, activities, approvals, evidence, retests cascade away | P9 | Critical — silent loss of risk decisions and audit trail |
| B2 | Ingest check-then-write race: loser counts "created", fires hooks with a phantom id; `ON CONFLICT` overwrites `work_item_uris` and `metadata` | P1, P1b | High — lost ticket links, double notifications, orphan side rows |
| B3 | SAST identity includes line numbers (semgrep fallback, SARIF without `fingerprints`, F1 `sast`) | P4 | High — triage (FP, accepted) lost on every refactor |
| B4 | Secret identity includes the line; masks collide | P12 | High — secret triage lost on edits; distinct secrets merged |
| B5 | SCA identity includes the installed version | P5 | High — ticket/assignee/SLA history split on every bump |
| B6 | Cross-tool merged findings auto-resolved by `tool_name` (first writer) | P11 | High — flapping status, false "fixed" metrics |
| B7 | `http_service`/`discovered_url` stored names (`https:::host`) differ from lookup keys | P17 | High — asset sprawl, findings split across 3 assets |
| B8 | Cloud compute/serverless ARNs truncated at `/` | P17 | High — **wrong merge** of distinct machines |
| B9 | Asset key ignores type; a host is absorbed into a domain row | P17 | Medium — wrong type, wrong scans |
| B10 | `occurrence_count` never increments on the main path | P8 | Medium — "seen N times" is false |
| B11 | DAST without a sensor fingerprint keys on rule + title | P6 | Medium — distinct URLs merged |
| B12 | Network VA keys on the lowest CVE of a multi-CVE plugin; port vs host-level split | P2 | Medium — duplicates across Nessus/Qualys/Tenable |
| B13 | Same CVE via package (trivy) and host (Tenable) — no correlation | P2 | Medium — double counting in risk and SLA |
| B14 | Pentest identity = campaign + title (no asset) | code | Medium — cannot file the same issue on two assets |
| B15 | Manual fingerprint has no field separators | P13 | Low — collision by construction |
| B16 | `findings.cve_id` not case-normalized; GHSA/OSV aliases unused | P14 | Low/Medium — CVE filters, KEV joins miss rows |
| B17 | Asset normalizer gaps: IDN, IPv4 leading zeros, `.git/`, container `docker.io/library/`, S3 URL forms, cert fingerprint forms, URL with/without scheme | P3, P17 | Medium — asset sprawl |
| B18 | Batch upserts without in-batch dedup: one duplicate fails the **whole** exposure batch (0 rows) and drops **all** branch occurrences of a report; same shape in certmonitor (overlapping roots) and EPSS sync | P18 | High — silent loss of a whole batch |
| B19 | Network VA without a CVE keys on rule + title: one plugin on ports 443 and 8443 → one finding | P18 | Medium — **wrong merge** |
| B20 | Exposure fingerprints embed `asset_id` and are not recomputed on asset merge (and CT's `nearestAsset` changes) → duplicate exposures, the moved one never auto-resolves | code | Medium |
| B21 | Tickets: read → create → write array, no uniqueness; concurrent `create_ticket` → two issues; GitHub repo match case-sensitive → a new issue every run | code | Medium — duplicate tickets, orphan issues |
| B22 | Tenant-wide threat model: `UNIQUE` with a NULL column → two models | P18 | Low |
| B23 | Converter fingerprints discarded (Nessus `nessus:…`, DefectDojo `defectdojo:…` not hex); `/ingest/scanner` SARIF adapter picks a **random** `fingerprints` entry; in-tree adapters and sensor parsers fingerprint the same tool differently | code | Medium — duplicates on re-import |
| B24 | No dedup key on notifications, commands, threat actors; IOC values not canonicalized; PURLs verbatim; asset-components index collides across ecosystems and the error is swallowed | code | Medium |

Not data loss, but blocking any fix: no fingerprint records its algorithm or
version (P15), so today **no recipe can be changed without re-keying every
finding** (mass "new" + mass auto-resolve).

## 3. Goals and non-goals

Goals

- One canonical identity per entity, defined in one place, versioned, and
  testable as a pure function.
- No dedup step ever deletes a row that carries human state.
- Ingest is safe under concurrency and re-delivery: rows, counters and hooks.
- Changing a fingerprint recipe is a migration that preserves triage state.
- The same vulnerability on the same asset seen by several tools is presented
  and counted once, and closed only when every source agrees.

Non-goals

- The asset identity model (canonical/link/source layers) — RFC-042.
- Fuzzy / ML dedup of findings. Correlation stays deterministic; similarity
  suggestions may come later as review items, never automatic merges.
- Cross-tenant dedup. Identity is always tenant-scoped (catalog rows such as
  `vulnerabilities` stay global).

## 4. Canonical identity per entity

### 4.1 Principles

1. **Server-computed.** The sensor's `Finding.Fingerprint` is stored as a
   sighting attribute (`external_fingerprint`) and may be used as a tiebreaker
   inside one tool, but it is never the identity (RFC-040: a sensor's claim is a
   hint). Today a 16-hex string from any sensor becomes the identity verbatim.
2. **Tuple first, hash second.** Store the canonical tuple
   (`identity_key JSONB`) next to the hash so a recipe change can be recomputed
   from the row, without the original report. This replaces the
   `partial_fingerprints["composite/base"]` workaround of #263.
3. **Versioned and separated.**
   `fingerprint = sha256("v" || version || 0x1f || kind || 0x1f || field1 || 0x1f || …)`.
   The unit separator closes B15 and the `:`-joined ambiguity in
   `ctis/fingerprint`.
4. **No secrets, no volatile fields.** Never a raw or masked secret (use the
   per-tenant HMAC of #849), never a line number when a stable anchor exists,
   never a message or title, never a scanner-local id (plugin id, QID) when a
   canonical vulnerability id exists.
5. **Asset-scoped through the canonical asset id** (RFC-042), so an asset merge
   re-keys findings by recomputing from `identity_key`, not by guessing.

### 4.2 Finding identity recipes (version 2)

| Kind | Identity tuple | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SAST | asset, rule family¹, repo-relative POSIX path², logical location (function), `hash(normalized snippet)` | Falls back to `(…, start_line bucket)` only when there is no snippet. Matches ctis `sast-content`; the API must pass `Snippet` and `LogicalLocation` (it does not today). SARIF `partialFingerprints.primaryLocationLineHash` is accepted as the snippet hash when present |
| SCA | asset, ecosystem + package name (PURL **without** version, qualifiers normalized³), canonical vuln id⁴ | Version moves to the sighting (`installed_version`, `fixed_version`); manifest path moves to a location list. Decision D2 on manifest-level splitting |
| Container | asset (image repository, RFC-042), package (PURL w/o version), canonical vuln id | Digest and tag on the sighting |
| Secret | asset, `secret_fingerprint` (HMAC of the normalized **raw** secret under a server-held per-tenant key — not #849's key, which is a public constant + tenant id, and not over the masked string), repo-relative path | No line. Same secret in two files → two findings, one correlation group |
| DAST | asset, canonical rule⁵, method, normalized URL template⁶, sorted parameter names | Query **values** dropped, names kept |
| Network VA | asset, canonical vuln id, `port/proto` (or `host` for host-level) | Multi-CVE plugin → one finding per CVE (decision D3), not "lowest id" |
| Misconfig / IaC | asset, policy id (canonical), resource id (type + name or address), repo-relative path | No message |
| Cloud (CSPM) | asset (provider resource id), policy id | Account-level controls key on the account asset |
| Pentest | asset, campaign, author-chosen `finding_key` (default: slug of the first title, frozen at creation) | Title edits do not re-key; same title on two assets is allowed |
| Manual | asset, user-supplied rule or CVE, path, line — v2 recipe with separators | Optional "link to existing finding" instead of a new row |
| Validation evidence, retest | not deduplicated as findings; bound to `finding_id`, idempotent on `(finding_id, attempt_id)` | §8 |

¹ rule family: the tool's rule id with known renames mapped (a small, versioned
alias table per tool, e.g. semgrep `python.lang.security.x` → `…v2`).
² repo-relative POSIX path: strip the scan root, `\` → `/`, collapse `./`, keep
case (paths are case-sensitive on most VCS).
³ PURL: type and namespace lower-cased per the PURL spec's per-type rules
(npm/pypi names lower-case, pypi `_`→`-`), version and qualifiers dropped.
⁴ canonical vuln id: resolve aliases through a `vulnerability_aliases` table
(OSV `aliases`, GHSA ↔ CVE); prefer CVE > GHSA > OSV/vendor; upper-case.
⁵ canonical rule: nuclei template id; for CVE templates the CVE id.
⁶ URL template: scheme + lower-case host (IDNA) + default-port strip + path
with numeric/uuid segments replaced by `{id}` (decision D4).

### 4.3 Other entities (summary; details in the architecture doc)

| Entity | Canonical identity | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| Asset | RFC-042 deterministic keys | RFC-042 |
| Vulnerability | canonical id after alias resolution | `UNIQUE(cve_id)` + `vulnerability_aliases(alias UNIQUE)` |
| Component | normalized PURL without qualifiers | `UNIQUE(purl)` on the normalized form |
| Ticket | (finding or correlation group, provider, project) | new `UNIQUE` (§7) |
| Notification | (tenant, rule, event type, entity, window) dedup key | outbox `UNIQUE(dedup_key)` (§7) |
| Ingest report | (tenant, sensor, report_id) | existing v2 key; v1 gets one (§8) |
| Command / scan run | client idempotency key | `UNIQUE(tenant_id, idempotency_key)` (§8) |

## 5. Write path: one atomic upsert

Replace check-then-write with:

```sql
INSERT INTO findings (…) VALUES …
ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, fingerprint) DO UPDATE SET
    -- observation columns only
    last_seen_at = EXCLUDED.last_seen_at,
    scan_id = EXCLUDED.scan_id,
    occurrence_count = findings.occurrence_count + 1,
    severity = …, cvss_* = …, epss_* = …,   -- per the enrichment rules
    snippet = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.snippet, findings.snippet), …
RETURNING id, (xmax = 0) AS inserted, status;
```

- The conflict set lists **observation columns only**. `work_item_uris`,
  `metadata` user keys, `assigned_to`, `sla_deadline`, `priority_class_override*`,
  `status`, `resolution*` are never in it (today `work_item_uris` and `metadata`
  are, `finding_repository.go:543,564`).
- Duplicates inside one batch are merged in memory before the statement
  (Postgres refuses to update one row twice).
- `RETURNING` drives everything after: ids are remapped from the database, and
  hooks (created callback, assignment, remediation key, exposure bridge,
  notifications) run **only for `inserted = true`**.
- Reopen becomes part of the same statement's follow-up on `inserted = false`
  rows whose returned status is closed-as-fixed, so the regression decision sees
  the committed row, not a pre-read.
- Enrichment of existing rows stops being read-modify-write: per-column SQL
  expressions (`GREATEST`, array union, `jsonb ||` on scanner-owned keys only).

## 6. Fingerprint versioning and re-fingerprint migration

Schema:

```sql
ALTER TABLE findings ADD COLUMN fingerprint_version SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
                     ADD COLUMN identity_key JSONB;
CREATE TABLE finding_fingerprints (
    tenant_id   UUID NOT NULL,
    fingerprint TEXT NOT NULL,
    finding_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES findings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    version     SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, fingerprint)
);
```

Ingest computes the current-version fingerprint, looks it up in
`finding_fingerprints` (any version) and upserts on the alias. Migration to a new
version, per tenant, in batches, resumable:

1. Compute `v_new` from `identity_key` (or, for v1 rows without one, from the
   row's columns where that is lossless — SAST rows with a snippet, SCA rows with
   a PURL; rows that cannot be recomputed keep v1 and are re-keyed on their next
   sighting by matching the v1 alias).
2. Insert the alias `(v_new → finding_id)`. On conflict two v1 findings map to
   one v2 identity: run the **finding merge** of §9 (survivor + tombstone), never
   a delete.
3. Flip `fingerprint_version`; keep the v1 alias for N days so late reports in
   the old scheme still land on the right row; then drop it.
4. Auto-resolve is **suspended** for a tenant while its migration runs (an
   unmatched old key must not close findings).

Dry-run mode reports, per tenant: rows re-keyed, merges it would make, rows it
cannot recompute.

## 7. Cross-tool correlation, tickets and notifications

### 7.1 Correlation group

Same canonical vulnerability on the same canonical asset reported through
different techniques (package scan vs network scan vs DAST CVE template) stays
**separate findings** — they have different fixes and different evidence — but
share a `correlation_id = sha256(v ‖ asset ‖ canonical_vuln_id)` (the column
exists and is unused). Effects:

- risk, SLA and dashboard counts count the group once (worst member);
- the UI shows the group with its members;
- triage of one member can be offered to the others (decision D5: offer, not
  automatic);
- one ticket per group by default (§7.2).

### 7.2 Tickets

- `UNIQUE (tenant_id, provider, project, subject_type, subject_id)` on the
  ticket link table, `subject` = finding or correlation group. Creation is
  insert-first (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`), and only the inserter calls
  the provider. A re-detection comments on the existing ticket instead of
  opening a new one; a regression reopens it.
- On a finding merge the survivor takes the union of links; the loser's ticket
  gets a "duplicate of" comment.

### 7.3 Notifications

- Dedup key `(tenant, rule, event_type, entity_id, window_start)` on the outbox,
  `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
- Storm control: above N events per rule per window, collapse into one digest
  (count + top items).
- Only `inserted = true` rows emit "new finding"; a reopen emits "regression"
  once per `(finding, reopen)`.

## 8. Lifecycle per sighting (auto-resolve interplay)

Adopt ADR-004's sighting model now (`finding_sightings`: finding, tool, channel,
sensor, scan/report, external fingerprint, first/last seen, installed version,
location). Then:

- **Default-branch and coverage auto-resolve close a sighting**, keyed on the
  sighting's tool — not on `findings.tool_name`.
- A finding is closed-as-fixed only when **no sighting is open**. A tool that
  stops reporting closes its own sighting only. B6 disappears.
- Coverage-scoped auto-resolve (`coverage_autoresolve.go`) already checks that the
  last sighting belongs to a run of the same profile; with sightings that check
  becomes exact per tool.
- Reopen (scan, retest, IOC, exception expiry) reopens the sighting and the
  finding; RFC-039's fresh SLA on regression applies once per reopen.
- Asset merge moves sightings with their findings; coverage state already moves
  (`scan_coverage_state` in `asset_merge_plan.go`).
- Ingest reports: v1 gets the v2 rule — `(tenant, sensor, report_id)` unique, a
  re-sent report is a no-op on sightings (today it re-runs enrichment).
- Validation evidence and retests: idempotent on `(finding_id, attempt_id)`.

## 9. Merge and split semantics

One procedure, used by asset merge, fingerprint migration and a new manual
"mark duplicate of":

1. Choose the survivor: the finding on the kept asset; else the oldest.
2. **State inheritance** (in the merge transaction):

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| status / resolution | the more deliberate wins: `false_positive`, `accepted` (risk) > `in_progress`/`fix_applied` > `confirmed` > `new`; a closed-as-fixed loser never closes an open survivor. Conflicting deliberate decisions (FP vs accepted) → keep survivor's, raise a review item |
| assignee, groups | survivor's; else loser's; group assignments unioned |
| SLA | earliest `first_detected_at` → earliest deadline; breach history kept |
| tickets (`work_item_uris`, ticket links) | union; loser's ticket commented "duplicate of" |
| comments, activities, approvals, evidence, retests, verification checklists, AI triage, compliance mappings, compensating controls | **re-parented** to the survivor (UPDATE `finding_id`), with an activity "merged from <id>" |
| suppressions / exceptions | union; the stricter expiry wins |
| sightings, branch occurrences, data flows, remediation keys | moved, deduplicated on their own keys |
| loser row | `status = duplicate`, `duplicate_of = survivor`, kept (tombstone) so URLs, tickets and audit references resolve |

3. Runs **inside** the asset-merge transaction (today the recompute runs after
   commit, best-effort, `admin_dedup_handler.go:83`).
4. **Split** (RFC-042 un-merge): findings follow their sightings' source
   records; a finding whose sightings now point to two assets is cloned per
   asset, state copied, both linked in an activity. Never automatic: split is an
   admin action with a preview.

## 10. Asset normalization fixes that cannot wait for RFC-042

RFC-042 owns the model; these are bugs in today's normalizer, each with a probe:

- `NewAsset` must normalize with the sub-type it is given (B7: pass sub-type into
  the constructor; `processor_assets.go:1664`, `asset/service.go:328`, `import.go:88`).
- Cloud resource ids must not go through the DNS normalizer (B8): ARNs are
  identifiers; case rules per provider.
- The asset unique key includes the type family, or a cross-type collision raises
  a review instead of absorbing (B9; decision D6).
- IDNA (UTS-46) to A-labels for DNS names, hosts and URL hosts; strict IPv4
  (reject leading zeros or canonicalize as decimal, decision D7); `.git` and
  trailing slash strip in a fixed order; `ssh://` repo URLs; container image
  references via the distribution reference grammar (`docker.io/library/`
  default, digest identity); S3 URL forms; certificate identity = SHA-256 of the
  DER (not CN).
- One wildcard rule for CT and ingest (decision D8).

## 11. Test strategy

1. **Property tests** (`pgregory.net/rapid` or `testing/quick`) for every
   normalizer and recipe: idempotence `N(N(x)) = N(x)`; invariance under case,
   surrounding whitespace, trailing dot, default port, path separator; recipes
   are injective over field boundaries (fuzz `a‖b` splits); the type never
   changes the result of the asset normalizer for equal sub-types between
   constructor and lookup.
2. **Golden corpus** `testdata/dedup/`: real tool outputs (semgrep, CodeQL SARIF,
   trivy fs/image/config, betterleaks, nuclei, Nessus, Qualys, Tenable) in pairs
   `{before, after, expect: same|different}` — line shift, version bump,
   re-tag, secret move, multi-CVE plugin, URL query churn, rule rename. A recipe
   change must state which golden pairs change outcome.
3. **Concurrency tests** on a migrated database: N goroutines ingest one report;
   assert one row, one "created", hooks once, counters exact; run with `-race`.
4. **Merge tests**: every table that references `findings(id)` is either
   re-parented or listed as deliberately dropped — the same shape as
   `TestAssetMergeCoversEveryAssetReference`, for findings.
5. **Migration tests**: v1 → v2 re-key on a fixture with triaged findings; no
   status, ticket, comment or activity lost; dry-run equals real run.
6. **Schema gate**: every table with an identity column has a `UNIQUE` (or a
   documented exemption) and no nullable column in a unique key without
   `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`.

## 12. Phase plan

**P0 — stop losing data (proven bugs, highest integrity risk)**

1. Asset merge: replace the collision `DELETE` with the §9 merge (survivor +
   tombstone + re-parent) and run it inside the merge transaction (B1).
2. Finding upsert: drop `work_item_uris` and `metadata` from the conflict set;
   add `RETURNING id, (xmax = 0)`; hooks and counters only for inserted rows;
   dedupe the batch in memory (B2, P7).
3. `occurrence_count` increments atomically on every sighting (B10).
4. Asset normalizer: sub-type in the constructor (B7); ARNs out of the DNS path
   (B8). Both with a migration that finds already-garbled names and queues
   dedup reviews (not automatic merges).
5. Stop auto-resolving rows whose `tool_name` differs from the last sighting's
   tool until sightings land (interim guard for B6).
6. In-batch dedup before every multi-row upsert: exposure `BulkUpsert`,
   branch occurrences, certmonitor, EPSS (B18). One helper, one test each.
7. Network VA without a CVE: port/proto in the key (B19 wrong merge).
8. Asset merge also recomputes exposure-event fingerprints, with the same
   survivor/tombstone rule (B20).
9. `threat_models`: `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (PG 15+) after collapsing
   existing duplicates (B22).

**P1 — versioned identity**

10. `fingerprint_version`, `identity_key`, `finding_fingerprints` alias table;
   ingest looks up by alias.
11. v2 recipes for SAST (snippet/logical location; SARIF partialFingerprints in
   sdk-go `FromSARIF`), secrets (HMAC from #849, no line), SCA (no version),
   DAST, network VA (one finding per CVE). Re-fingerprint migration with dry run.
12. Pentest `finding_key`; manual recipe with separators; "mark duplicate of"
   (writes `duplicate_of`). Converter fingerprints (Nessus, DefectDojo) kept as
   sighting keys; SARIF adapter picks `fingerprints` deterministically; one
   parser per tool (retire the in-tree adapters or make them call the sensor
   parsers) (B23).

**P2 — sightings and correlation**

13. `finding_sightings`; lifecycle per sighting (B6 for good); v1 report
   idempotency.
14. `vulnerability_aliases` and canonical vuln id; `cve_id` upper-case backfill
    (B16).
15. `correlation_id` groups; group-aware counts, SLA and UI (B13).

**P3 — tickets, notifications, assets**

16. Ticket link table with uniqueness and insert-first creation; case-insensitive provider matching; group tickets (B21).
17. Notification dedup key and storm digest; command idempotency keys; threat-actor and IOC canonical keys; PURL normalization (B24).
18. Remaining normalizer fixes (B9, B17) — coordinated with RFC-042.

**P4 — hardening**

19. Golden corpus in CI, property tests, schema gate, finding-merge coverage
    test; sensor fingerprints demoted to sighting attributes everywhere.

## 13. Owner decisions needed

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Is the sensor's fingerprint ever the identity? | No — a hint stored on the sighting (RFC-040) |
| D2 | SCA: one finding per (package, vuln) per asset, or per manifest? | Per asset; manifests as locations |
| D3 | Multi-CVE network plugin: one finding per CVE, or one per plugin with CVE list? | One per CVE (cross-scanner dedup needs it) |
| D4 | DAST URL template: replace numeric/uuid path segments? | Yes, with a per-tenant opt-out |
| D5 | Correlation group: propagate triage automatically? | Offer, do not auto-apply |
| D6 | Same name, different asset type: separate assets or review? | Separate rows keyed by type family; review on conflict |
| D7 | IPv4 with leading zeros: reject or canonicalize? | Reject (ambiguous octal) and log |
| D8 | Wildcard `*.example.com`: own asset or the parent? | Own asset, linked to the parent (it is a certificate/DNS fact, not a host) |
| D9 | Severity on re-ingest: MAX (today, `EnrichFrom`) or last-writer? | Per sighting; finding = max over open sightings, so a vendor downgrade can lower it |
| D10 | Tombstone retention for merged findings | Keep forever (cheap, keeps links valid) |
| D11 | Migration window: auto-resolve paused per tenant while re-keying | Yes |

## 14. Alternatives considered

- **Keep sensor fingerprints as identity** and fix each sensor: rejected — five
  producers already disagree, and a sensor is not trusted to define identity
  (RFC-040).
- **Fuzzy matching (similarity of message/location)**: rejected for automatic
  merges; acceptable later as review suggestions.
- **Delete-on-collision with "copy status first"**: rejected — 15 tables cascade;
  a copy list would rot exactly like the merge plan did before
  `TestAssetMergeCoversEveryAssetReference`.
