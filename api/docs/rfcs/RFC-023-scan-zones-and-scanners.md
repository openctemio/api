## 1. Problem

A tenant with segmented networks (e.g. `10.230.0.0/16`, `10.1.0.0/16`,
`10.210.0.0/16`, each reachable only from a scanner inside it) cannot express
"scans of 10.230.x run on the scanner in that network", and nothing stops any
scanner from scanning any address. The 2026-10-01 code review found:

1. **No zone, site or allowed-range concept** anywhere. A scan command carries
   no agent; any agent of the tenant may claim it. The poll matches only
   `required_capabilities` (`command_repository.go:117-148`); tool, tags and
   `routing_tags` are stored but never matched.
2. **Only the first target of a scan is dispatched**: `payload.target =
   sc.Targets[0]` (`scan/trigger.go:422`). A 10-address scan scans one.
3. **Private targets are refused at scan creation**
   (`WithAllowInternalIPs(false)`, `scan/crud.go:217`), so on-prem scanning only
   works through asset groups.
4. **Auto mode falls back to platform agents** when no tenant agent is free,
   without checking permission or target type (`scan/trigger.go:648-662`). In
   SaaS this would send a tenant's internal targets to shared infrastructure.
5. **Scope exclusions are fail-open** and applied only to asset-group scans;
   the agent ignores `excluded_asset_ids`.
6. **Agents trust any well-formed job over TLS**: commands are not signed, and
   the agent has no allowed-range guard (only a global
   `AGENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS`). A compromised control plane, or an attacker
   on the path, decides what every scanner scans. Also: `::/128` is not blocked,
   recon `extra_args` can add targets (`-u/-l/-host/-d`), hostnames are resolved
   without pinning (DNS rebinding).
7. **Agent keys never expire by default** (0 of 73 live agents have an
   expiry); key scopes are stored but not enforced.
8. **Tenable coverage jobs are unroutable**: dispatched with capability `infra`,
   which the agent never advertises.
9. **Overlapping private space within one tenant collapses**: assets are unique
   on `(tenant_id, name)`, so `10.0.0.5` at two sites is one asset.

## 2. What we learn from the field

| | Tenable SC | Tenable VM | Rapid7 InsightVM | Qualys | runZero |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Link direction | SC→scanner :8834 (managed) or scanner→SC :8837 (linked) | Scanner→cloud, linking key | Either; reverse uses 60-min secret | Appliance→cloud :443, polls 190 s | Explorer→cloud, stamped token |
| Routing | Scan zones (ranges→scanners), narrowest first, least busy | Scanner groups with routing targets, narrowest match | Site → engine/pool | Asset group → appliances | Site → explorers |
| Out-of-zone target | Enforced for linked; **ignored when one zone is selected** | **Skipped, partial results + warning** | Site-scoped | Group-scoped | Must be in task scope |
| Overlapping IP | Distribution across zones | "Networks" stamped on assets | Site-scoped correlation | "Networks" | Sites |
| Credentials | In SC, or CyberArk/Vault | Cloud or PAM | Console or CyberArk | **Appliance pulls from vault** | Sent only if task CIDR matches |
| Health | 16-flag status incl. fingerprint mismatch | Linked/online | Connection status | 4-h heartbeat | Online + approval |

Threat evidence that shapes the design: scanners are high-value pivots (stolen
scan credentials from compromised targets; a tampered target list redirecting
credentials to an attacker — Praetorian 2025); unauthenticated update channels
(Rapid7 CVE-2022-4261/3913); local privilege escalation in scanner agents
(Nessus Agent CVE-2024-3291/3292).

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **One "Scanners" resource** over everything that executes scans for a tenant: OpenCTEM agents (in-network, outbound-only) and external engines (Nessus Pro, Tenable.sc; OpenVAS/Qualys later) reached through a bridge agent. | Today they live on two pages with two status models. Tenable/Qualys show one list. |
| D2 | **Outbound-only.** Our scanners always connect out and long-poll; the control plane never opens a connection into a tenant network. External engines are reached by an agent in their zone ("bridge"). A direct control-plane→engine connection is allowed only for internet-reachable/cloud engines. | No inbound path into customer networks; matches Qualys/runZero/Tenable-linked; already decided for RFC-007. |
| D3 | **Scan zone** = tenant-owned: name, network, address ranges (IP, CIDR, IP ranges), assigned scanners, optional description. Overlapping zones are allowed for redundancy. | The routing primitive every vendor converges on. |
| D4 | **Routing: narrowest matching zone, then least-busy scanner with capacity**; targets are materialised and batched server-side (`TargetsPerJob`). | Tenable's algorithm; fixes the Targets[0] bug at the root. |
| D5 | **Out-of-zone targets are skipped with an explicit warning on the run, never sent to "any scanner".** Unlike SC, a selected zone's ranges are **always** enforced. | Fail closed; SC's single-zone bypass is a known pitfall. |
| D6 | **Zones are opt-in per tenant.** With no zones, behavior stays as today for public targets. Once a tenant defines a zone, private (RFC 1918 / ULA) targets **require** a zone; public targets and domains use the tenant's **Default zone** (internet-facing scanners). | No surprise breakage; private scanning becomes possible exactly where it is safe. |
| D7 | **Three independent enforcement layers.** (1) Dispatch pins the job to a zone scanner. (2) The claim query refuses a job whose targets are outside the polling scanner's zones. (3) **The scanner itself refuses** targets outside its allowed ranges, checked on resolved IPs with the resolved IP pinned for the scan. | Each layer survives the failure of the one before; layer 3 survives a compromised control plane only if its ranges do not come solely from that control plane (D8). |
| D8 | **Scanner allow-list = intersection of (a) zone ranges from a signed job manifest and (b) an optional operator-set local list** (`--allowed-ranges`, like Nessus `nessusd.rules`). The UI shows (b) as "locked by operator". Built-in deny always applies: loopback, link-local/IMDS, `::/128`, multicast, the control plane's own address. | (a) stops path attackers; only (b) stops a fully compromised control plane. Recommended for high-security sites. |
| D9 | **Signed jobs (Ed25519).** The control plane signs tenant, scanner id, command id, targets, tool, args digest, zone ranges, expiry and nonce, with a signing key held outside the database (KMS / mounted secret). The agent pins the public key at enrollment and checks signature, expiry, replay and allow-list before running. Agent updates/templates follow the same rule. | Turns "anyone who can write the commands table or MITM the link" into "needs the signing key". |
| D10 | **Enrollment:** single-use token valid ≤60 min, bound to the tenant and optionally a zone → per-scanner key with **default 90-day TTL and auto-renew** (RFC-014 machinery, now on by default); **new scanners are "pending approval"** and get no jobs until a tenant admin approves; revoke takes effect on the next poll. | Rapid7 60-min secret, runZero approve-to-trust; closes "keys never expire". |
| D11 | **Fixed capability set.** Scanners run typed scan jobs only: no shell, tunnel or free-form command. `extra_args` are allow-listed per tool; target-bearing flags are rejected. | Removes the pivot surface (runZero model). |
| D12 | **Credential custody tiers.** T1 (default): secrets stay on the scanner/bridge or are pulled by it from the tenant's vault; the control plane never holds them. T2 (opt-in): stored encrypted in the control plane (refused when `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset), envelope-encrypted per job to the scanner's key, and **released only when the job's targets lie inside the credential's scope ranges**. | Qualys vault pull + runZero scoped release; matches the RFC-007 trust decision. |
| D13 | **Health as flags**, not one word: online, busy (+ free capacity), version / upgrade required, auth error, certificate mismatch, fingerprint mismatch (engine UUID changed), plugins/templates out of sync, disabled, pending approval, quarantined. "Update status" runs an on-demand probe. A scanner silent past N heartbeats, or whose fingerprint changed, is quarantined automatically. | SC's 16-flag status is what operators rely on; quarantine is the safe default. |
| D14 | **Platform layer** (RFC-022 console): shared scanners and zones offered to tenants. They may scan **public** targets only, never receive tenant credentials, and are always labelled "shared". The silent auto-fallback to platform agents is removed: using them is an explicit per-scan or per-tenant choice. | Matches SC's admin-assigned zones without leaking internal targets. |
| D15 | **Networks for overlapping space** (later phase): every zone belongs to a network (one default network per tenant); asset identity becomes `(tenant, network, address)` for network addresses, and results are stamped with the scanner's network. | Tenable VM / Qualys "networks", runZero "sites"; required for multi-site customers reusing 10/8. |
| D16 | **Permissions:** `scanners:read/write/delete`, `zones:read/write/delete`, `scanners:approve` (tenant owner/admin by default; members read-only). All zone, scanner, approval, key and credential-release events are audited. | Least privilege; a new permission is added in Go, the seed migration and the UI constants together (authorization-matrix rules). |
| D17 | **Scope stays separate from zones.** Scope = *may* we scan this; zone = *who can reach* it. Exclusions are enforced at dispatch for **every** path and fail closed; an optional tenant setting requires targets to be in scope. | Two questions, one CIDR matcher (`pkg/domain/scope`). |

## 4. Extensibility: sensors built with the SDK

The platform is designed so that third parties write their own tools, agents,
connectors and collectors with `sdk-go` (`core.Scanner`, `core.Collector`,
`core.Connector`/`Provider`, `core.Parser`, `core.Agent`, `Pusher`, the
`platform` poller) and push data in. Zones must not depend on *our* agent
behaving well, so:

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D18 | **"Sensor" is the umbrella term** (Tenable VM *Settings → Sensors*, Qualys *Sensors*): software running on the customer side that authenticates **to** the platform with its own key and heartbeat. Sensors are classified by **operational role**, as Tenable separates scanners from agents: **Scanner** — network vantage point that assesses *other* hosts, routed by **scan zone** (our in-network runtime in scan mode; external engines such as Nessus/Tenable.sc/OpenVAS behind a scanner acting as bridge). **Agent** — installed on an endpoint, reports only about *its own* host (inventory, local vulnerabilities, telemetry), grouped by **agent group**, never receives network targets. **Collector** — pushes data from systems inside the customer network (SIEM forwarder, CMDB), never receives targets. **Network monitor** — passive (later). **Integration** stays the term for external systems the *platform* calls with credentials (Jira, Slack, Splunk out, GitHub, Wiz API) or that call in via webhook; no software of ours runs for them. Rule: *who runs the code and who holds the identity.* | Today's "Agent" is a Tenable-style **scanner**; keeping that name would mislead anyone who knows Tenable. One registry, approval, key and health model for every role, first- or third-party. |
| D18a | **Roles are capabilities, approved separately.** One runtime built with the SDK may hold several roles (e.g. scanner + collector). Each role is declared, approved and audited on its own and carries its own rules: only the *scanner* role receives network targets and is zone-checked; the *agent* role is bound to its own host identity; the *collector* role can only push its declared data kinds. In the SDK, `core.Scanner` / `core.Collector` / `core.Connector` map to these roles and `core.Agent` is documented as the **sensor runtime** that hosts them. | Flexible for SDK authors without letting one role borrow another's powers. |
| D18b | **Migration without breakage.** API paths and tables keep the name `agents` (plus a `role` column); every existing agent becomes a **scanner** (what they do today). UI and docs move to the new terms; `/agents` redirects to *Settings → Sensors*. Tabs: **Scanners · Agents · Collectors · Scan zones · Networks**, one "Add sensor" flow (one-time enrollment token → approval). Supersedes the 2026-08 naming decision ("Agent" as the umbrella runtime term). | Correct vocabulary for users, zero API churn for SDK consumers. |
| D19 | **The rules are protocol, the code is SDK.** Signature/expiry/replay checks, the allow-list on resolved IPs with pinning, the built-in deny list and per-target skip reporting live in `sdk-go` (`platform` poller + a guarded resolver/dialer handed to scanners). A tool implementing `core.Scanner` is only ever called with targets that already passed the guard, and gets a pinned address to use. Our agent is just one consumer of the SDK. | Third-party runners inherit the controls without writing them; one audited implementation. |
| D20 | **Capability negotiation.** At enrollment and on every heartbeat a sensor declares: protocol version, SDK version, **features** (`signed_jobs`, `zone_guard`, `ip_pinning`) and a **tool manifest** per tool (target kinds accepted: ip/cidr/domain/url/repo/image/cloud; whether it needs network reach; output types; credential needs). The server routes by manifest: zone routing applies only to network-reaching tools (a repo SAST tool needs no zone). **Jobs with private network targets are dispatched only to sensors that advertise `signed_jobs` + `zone_guard`**, unless the tenant explicitly allows legacy sensors (shown as a warning). | Safe by default for unknown code; non-network tools are unaffected. |
| D21 | **Push is authorized, not just authenticated.** A sensor key's scopes (stored today, enforced from now) limit: the data kinds it may write (findings, assets, telemetry, …); the **tool names it may report as** (a collector must not report as `nessus` and auto-resolve real Nessus findings, since auto-resolve is scoped by tool); and, for zone-bound runners, the addresses it may report on (results outside its zones are quarantined for review, not ingested). Every record is stamped with sensor id, kind and zone (provenance). | Closes forged-result and cross-network write paths that any SDK user could otherwise reach. |
| D22 | **Trust tiers.** *First-party* (our signed builds), *verified* (passes the SDK conformance suite, signed release), *custom* (tenant-built, approved by a tenant admin). Custom sensors never receive control-plane-held credentials (T2) and their findings are labelled as such; platform-shared scanners are first-party only. | Openness without granting unknown code the most sensitive powers. |
| D23 | **Conformance suite in the SDK** (`platform/conformance`): a fake control plane that proves a sensor rejects unsigned, expired, replayed and out-of-range jobs, never dials the deny list, reports skips, and honours revocation. Required for *verified*. | Makes "secure by default" checkable by third parties and in our CI. |
| D24 | **Versioned protocol.** The server publishes a minimum protocol version and a deprecation window; sensors below it keep pushing (collectors) but receive no new jobs; the UI flags "upgrade required". | Lets the platform evolve security requirements without breaking the ecosystem overnight. |

## 4b. Protocol v2: identity, integrity and supply chain

*Enrollment, identity and capability trust (D10, D20, D22, P1–P4) are
specified in detail by [RFC-032](RFC-032-sensor-enrollment-and-identity.md),
which takes precedence where the two differ.*

Target model for every sensor (first- or third-party), chosen to be the most
secure option that still works through corporate proxies and for third-party
developers. Sources: GitHub Actions runner auth, Kubernetes kubelet TLS
bootstrapping, Tenable sensor linking, Elastic Fleet message signing, Datadog
Remote Config (TUF), Nuclei template signing (and its CVE-2024-43405 bypass),
RFC 9421 / 9449 / 9530 / 8705, OWASP API Top 10 2023, NIST SP 800-204/207,
CISA Secure by Design.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| P1 | **No bearer secret on the wire after enrollment.** Enrollment uses a single-use token (≤60 min, hashed at rest, bound to tenant + role, optionally zone). The sensor generates an **Ed25519 key pair locally** (private key never leaves the host; file mode 0600, or the OS keystore/TPM when available) and registers only the public key. Today's `rda_` keys become v1-only. |
| P2 | **Every request is signed** with HTTP Message Signatures (**RFC 9421**) over method, target URI, **Content-Digest (RFC 9530)**, `created` and a nonce, keyed by the sensor id. The server allows ±5 min clock skew and rejects replayed nonces. Unlike mTLS this survives TLS-terminating proxies and load balancers, and a captured request or log line cannot be replayed or reused. |
| P3 | **Optional mTLS mode** for self-hosted, high-assurance deployments: kubelet-style CSR enrollment, client certificates of ≤24 h renewed at half-life, and a SPIFFE federation hook for organisations already running SPIRE. |
| P4 | **Automatic key rotation and instant revocation.** The sensor rotates its key every 30 days (the new public key is submitted signed by the old one); revocation and quarantine are checked on every request, not at connect. |
| P5 | **Jobs are JWS (EdDSA) envelopes** carrying tenant, sensor id, command id, targets, tool, args digest, zone ranges, `iat`/`exp`, nonce and key id. The SDK verifies before parsing anything else and **executes exactly the verified bytes** (the Nuclei CVE-2024-43405 lesson: never verify one representation and run another). |
| P6 | **Signing keys rotate without re-enrolling the fleet** (avoids Elastic Fleet's forced re-enrolment): an offline **root key** signs a published key set of online job-signing keys with expiries (TUF-style roles); the sensor pins the root public key at enrollment and refreshes the key set on heartbeat. |
| P7 | **Content and updates are signed too:** scan templates and checks (code-type templates must be signed), tool bundles and sensor self-updates are delivered with TUF metadata (expiry, rollback and freeze protection). |
| P8 | **Supply chain for every release** of the SDK, the agent and the images: keyless **Sigstore cosign** signatures, **SLSA Build L3** provenance, a CycloneDX **SBOM**, `-trimpath` reproducible builds, `govulncheck` + `gosec` + lint gates; installers verify signatures before running anything. |
| P9 | **Push integrity:** the signed request covers the body digest; each report carries an `Idempotency-Key` (retries never duplicate); strict schema validation with size, depth and decompression limits; per-sensor quotas and rate limits; provenance stamped **by the server**; anomalous pushes (volume spikes, out-of-zone or out-of-job assets) are quarantined for review instead of merged. The results contract is [RFC-026](RFC-026-sensor-results-ingest.md): CTIS only, `PUT /api/v2/sensor/results/{report_id}` (the sensor-chosen id in the URL replaces the `Idempotency-Key` header), self-describing segments + commit, `Content-Digest` mandatory from the first v2 release. |
| P10 | **Transport:** TLS 1.3 preferred with 1.2 as the floor, and the hybrid post-quantum key exchange (X25519MLKEM768) that Go's `crypto/tls` already negotiates by default; operator-supplied CA bundle pinning (no hard-coded leaf pins, which break inspecting proxies); `InsecureSkipVerify` impossible without an explicit dev flag; redirects never carry credentials across origins or downgrade to HTTP; HTTPS long-poll kept (proxy- and firewall-friendly), with HTTP/2. |
| P11 | **Crypto agility:** every envelope and key carries an algorithm id, so signatures can move to post-quantum ML-DSA later without a protocol break. |
| P12 | **Tamper-evident audit** of enrollment, approval, key rotation and revocation, job signing, credential release and quarantine, in the hash-chained audit log (whose current chain-break bug is fixed first). |
| P13 | **SDK secure defaults are not optional:** the SDK's HTTP client, resolver guard, verification and bounded readers are on by default and cannot be silently weakened; a conformance suite (D23) proves it for third-party sensors. |

**v1 during the transition.** v1 sensors (static `rda_` key, unsigned jobs)
keep working (§9), but receive compensating server-side controls: zone routing
and the claim predicate (layers 1–2), push scopes, quotas and quarantine,
default key expiry, and "legacy" labelling. Private-network jobs go to v1
scanners only where the tenant has allowed legacy scanners. Raising the minimum
protocol (C7) then retires v1 on the operator's schedule.

## 5. Data model (Phase 1–2)

```
scan_networks   id, tenant_id, name, is_default                      (Phase 4 uses it for identity)
scan_zones      id, tenant_id, network_id, name, description, is_default,
                ranges inet/cidr[] (validated, normalised, no /0 for private),
                created_by, created_at, updated_at
scan_zone_scanners  zone_id, agent_id   (PK both; same-tenant enforced in SQL)
agents          (the sensor registry) + role (scanner|agent|collector|monitor; a
                runtime may hold several roles), + bridge_engine (for scanners fronting an engine),
                + approval_state (pending|approved|rejected), + trust_tier,
                + protocol_version, sdk_version, features text[], tool_manifest jsonb,
                + health_flags int, + allowed_ranges_local cidr[] (reported, read-only in UI)
agent_api_keys  scopes enforced: ingest kinds, reportable tool names
scanner_engines id, tenant_id, kind (nessus_pro|tenable_sc|openvas…), name, host, port,
                verify_tls, ca_pin/fingerprint, use_proxy, bridge_agent_id,
                credential_tier (agent_local|vault|control_plane), credential_ref,
                health_flags, engine_uuid, version, last_status_at
```

Routing and claim queries use a single CIDR matcher (reuse
`pkg/domain/scope` matching). All tables carry `tenant_id` and every query is
tenant-scoped.

## 6. Flow

1. **Create scan**: targets validated; private targets accepted when the tenant
   has a zone covering them (D6). Exclusions removed (fail closed).
2. **Trigger**: materialise targets (expand asset groups server-side), group by
   narrowest zone, batch by `TargetsPerJob`, pick the least-busy approved
   scanner in the zone, create one signed command per batch pinned to it.
   Uncovered targets are listed in the run's warnings.
3. **Poll/claim**: the query returns only commands pinned to the caller, or
   unpinned ones whose targets lie in the caller's zones and whose tool the
   caller has (layer 2).
4. **Execute**: the agent verifies signature, expiry and replay, intersects the
   manifest ranges with its local list, resolves hostnames, rejects any resolved
   IP outside the allow-list or in the built-in deny list, pins the IP, runs the
   typed tool (layer 3), and reports per-target skips.
5. **Results**: ingest as today; results stamped with zone (and network, Phase 4).
   In protocol v2, results bound to a command carry it in the URL, so the zone
   is stamped per record ([RFC-026](RFC-026-sensor-results-ingest.md) §5).

## 7. UI (tenant admin)

**Settings → Scanning resources**, in the shape of SC's "Nessus Scanners" page:

- **Scanners** tab: one table of agents and engines — name, type, capabilities,
  status (flag pills: Working, Pending approval, Auth error, …), host, version,
  zones, uptime, last seen. Actions: **Add** (agent: one-time enrollment command;
  engine: form with name, description, host, port 8834, enabled, verify TLS,
  proxy, authentication with custody tier, zones, bridge agent), **Update
  status**, **Approve**, **Revoke**, **Rotate key**.
- **Scan zones** tab: name, ranges, scanners, coverage of assets (how many
  inventory addresses fall in no zone), and warnings for private ranges without
  a scanner.
- **New scan**: a zone picker (Automatic by default), and a preview of which
  targets go to which scanner and which are skipped.

## 8. Phases

| Phase | Content | Ships |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Fix what is broken today** (no new concepts) | All targets dispatched, batched by `TargetsPerJob`; remove the silent platform fallback (D14); exclusions fail closed on every path; agent: block `::/128`, reject target-bearing `extra_args`, pin resolved IPs; poll matches tool; Tenable `infra` capability fixed. | api + agent |
| **1 — Zones** | Tables, API, permissions, routing (D4–D6), claim predicate (layer 2), private targets allowed in zones, Scan zones UI, zone picker + routing preview on New scan. | api + ui |
| **2 — Sensors resource** | Sensor roles + capability negotiation (D18–D18b, D20), *Settings → Sensors* (Scanners/Agents/Collectors tabs), enrollment approval, default key TTL + auto-renew, health flags + Update status + quarantine, external engines via bridge (Nessus Pro first), push scopes enforced (D21). | api + agent + ui |
| **3 — Protocol v2 + enforcement in the SDK** | Ed25519 sensor identity + RFC 9421 request signing + key rotation (P1, P2, P4), JWS jobs with a TUF-style key hierarchy (P5, P6, D9), manifest + local allow-list + guarded resolver (D8, D19), typed `extra_args` allow-lists (D11), conformance suite (D23); our agent adopts it; private-target jobs require `signed_jobs`+`zone_guard` (D20); protocol versioning (D24). | sdk-go + agent + api |
| **4 — Credentials, networks, platform, trust, supply chain** | Signed templates/updates (P7), cosign + SLSA L3 + SBOM releases (P8), optional mTLS/SPIFFE (P3); credential tiers T1 vault pull / T2 scoped envelope release (D12); networks + site-aware asset identity (D15); platform shared scanners/zones (D14); trust tiers + verified sensors (D22). | api + sdk-go + agent + ui |

Each phase is shippable alone; Phase 0 is independent and should land first.

### 8.1 Phase 1 as implemented (API)

Decisions taken while building it, where this RFC left room:

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Permissions (D16) | `sensors:zones:read/write/delete`, in the `sensors` module next to `sensors:commands:*` (not a bare `zones:*`). Owner/admin all three, member/viewer read. Sensor assignment is `sensors:zones:write`. |
| `scan_networks` | Not created: Phase 4 (D15) is its first reader. Zones carry no `network_id` yet; adding it later is additive. |
| Table name | `scan_zone_sensors` (§5 said `scan_zone_scanners`; every row of `sensors` can be assigned until roles land in Phase 2). |
| Same-tenant rule (§11) | Composite foreign keys `(tenant_id, zone_id)` and `(tenant_id, sensor_id)`; platform sensors are refused by the insert. |
| Default zone | At most one per tenant; it may have no ranges; it receives public targets and public hostnames no range holds. Without one, those are dispatched as before zones (any tenant sensor, never silently platform, D14). |
| Range bounds | Deny-list overlap refused (so `/0` too), IPv4 ≥ /8, IPv6 ≥ /32, ≤ 256 prefixes per zone, ≤ 500 zones per tenant; `a-b` ranges expand to at most 16 CIDRs. |
| Batching | One command per batch of `targets_per_job`; one target per command for scanners that read a single target. This removes the Phase 0 "only the first target is scanned" caveat for zoned tenants. Tenants without zones keep the Phase 0 dispatch unchanged. |
| Least busy | Fewest active commands pinned to the sensor, then `current_jobs/max_concurrent_jobs`, balanced within the run. "Approved" = `status='active'` until Phase 2 adds approval state. |
| No healthy sensor | Batches are stamped with the zone, left unpinned, and wait for a zone sensor (warning on the run). A zone with no sensors assigned makes its targets uncovered. |
| Claim predicate (layer 2) | Applies to poll and acknowledge, to pinned commands too, and survives the reaper unpinning a command. Tool match: `payload.scanner` / `payload.preferred_tool`. |
| Run completion | All batches share the step run; the step settles once, after the last batch, with summed findings; a failed batch fails the step without a generic retry. |
| Workflow scans | Must route to a single zone (`ZONE_SPLIT_REQUIRED` otherwise); every step command is stamped with it. |
| Non-network tools | Tools whose supported targets are only files, repositories or containers are not zone-routed (D20, before the tool manifest exists). |
| Results (§6 step 5) | Stamped on the command only (`commands.scan_zone_id`): v1 ingest does not carry the command, so per-record zone provenance waits for D21 (Phase 2). |
| Run report | `GET /pipeline-runs/{id}` gains `dispatch` (resolved/excluded counts, warnings, uncovered targets with reasons, zone routing). |
| Zone picker | `scans.scan_zone_id` (null = Automatic). A selected zone's ranges are enforced (D5): the router runs over that zone alone and every other target is uncovered ("outside the selected scan zone"), public targets included unless it is the default zone. A pinned zone that was deleted fails the trigger (`SCAN_ZONE_NOT_FOUND`); deleting a zone scans pin is refused (409). |
| Routing preview | `POST /scan-zones/preview` (`sensors:zones:read`) runs creation's target validation, asset-group expansion, exclusions, routing, batching and sensor pinning read-only, and reports what a trigger would refuse in `error`. |

## 9. Renaming and compatibility plan

Goal: move to the Sensors vocabulary **without breaking any sensor or SDK in
the field**. Old SDK versions keep working unchanged; where a security feature
needs a newer SDK it is opt-in per sensor, and the platform gives operators a
lever to require it once they have upgraded.

### 9.1 Two axes instead of one `type`

Today `agents.type` mixes *what the sensor does* with *how it runs*
(`runner` = CI one-shot, `worker` = server-controlled daemon, `collector`,
`sensor` = "EASM sensor"; live also has legacy `scanner`). It is split into:

- **role**: `scanner | agent | collector | monitor` (D18); a runtime may hold several.
- **deployment**: `daemon` (long-running, pulls jobs) | `ephemeral` (CI / one-shot, push only).

| Legacy `type` | role | deployment | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `worker` | scanner | daemon | today's in-network runtime |
| `scanner` (legacy rows) | scanner | daemon | |
| `sensor` (EASM) | scanner | daemon | internet vantage point; the word *sensor* becomes the umbrella term |
| `collector` | collector | daemon | |
| `runner` | scanner | ephemeral | scans code/images in CI; non-network tools, so no zone routing |

`type` and `execution_mode` stay in the table and in the agent protocol; `role`
and `deployment` are new columns backfilled from them. The API keeps accepting
every legacy `type` value from old clients and maps it.

### 9.2 Compatibility contract (protocol v1 is frozen)

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| C1 | Every sensor-facing endpoint, auth header, request and response shape of today is **protocol v1** and frozen: changes are additive only, no field becomes required, enum values are only added. |
| C2 | The server accepts v1 payloads forever within a major version. New information (role, features, tool manifest, SDK/protocol version) is sent as **optional** fields on registration/heartbeat; provenance (sensor id, role, zone) is stamped **by the server**, never sent by the SDK. |
| C3 | **New SDK → older server:** the CTIS ingest decoder rejects unknown fields (`ingest_handler.go:387`), so a newer SDK must not add fields to existing payloads blindly. The server advertises its protocol level on every sensor response (`X-OpenCTEM-Protocol`) and a `GET /api/v1/agent/hello`; the SDK sends v2-only data only when advertised and otherwise behaves exactly as v1. |
| C4 | Management API (used by our UI): additive `role` / `deployment` fields; `type` stays in responses, marked deprecated. No URL renames; the rename is in the UI and docs. |
| C5 | Go SDK source compatibility: no exported identifier is renamed or removed in a minor release. New names are **aliases** (`type SensorRuntime = Agent`, role constants); `// Deprecated:` only once the replacement is stable; semver minor bumps. |
| C6 | Deployment compatibility: binary name, environment variables (`API_URL`, agent key, `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, `AGENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS`), Helm values (`agent.*`) and image names are unchanged. |
| C7 | Security features ride on top of v1: the job signature is an additive envelope a v1 SDK ignores; a sensor is switched to "signature required" only after it reports `signed_jobs`. A **minimum sensor protocol** setting (platform-wide, overridable per tenant; default v1) is the operator's upgrade lever: raising it stops new *jobs* to older scanners (collectors keep pushing, D24). The Sensors page shows the fleet by SDK/protocol version so upgrades can be planned. |
| C8 | Proven in CI: a compatibility job runs the **previous released** agent/SDK against the new API (register, heartbeat, poll, claim, push CTIS, renew key), plus golden fixtures of recorded v1 payloads. |

### 9.2a Heartbeat doorbell (protocol v1 additive extension)

**Requirement.** The heartbeat must also tell a sensor whether the platform
has something new for it, so the sensor pulls it, and stay as light as
possible.

**Decision.** The heartbeat is a *doorbell*: it signals that something is
waiting and when to ring again, and never carries a payload. Work is still
fetched and claimed through `GET /api/v1/agent/commands` and
`.../acknowledge`, so authorization, the zone claim predicate (layer 2) and
claim semantics stay in one place. Additive under C1: four optional,
`omitempty` response fields; no request field becomes required.

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `pending_jobs` | int, 1–100 (capped). Commands the sensor could claim now, by the poll's own predicate (pinned or unpinned, ready, `zoneClaimPredicate` incl. tool match, capability gate). Omitted when 0 and for platform sensors. |
| `next_heartbeat_seconds` | int. Busy 5 s (work waiting) · idle 30 s · loaded 120 s (doorbell query ≥ 250 ms). Clamped to [min 5 s, max 300 s] and to half the offline timeout (`WORKER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`, default 5 m ⇒ 150 s): a 300 s ceiling with a 300 s offline timeout would flap a compliant sensor offline. Env: `SENSOR_HEARTBEAT_*`. |
| `actions` | []string from the closed K1 subset `pause · resume · drain · rotate_key · update`. Wired: `pause` ⇐ sensor disabled; `rotate_key` ⇐ presented key inside its renewal window (`SENSOR_KEY_RENEW_BEFORE`, default ½ `SENSOR_KEY_TTL`). `resume` is implicit (first heartbeat without `pause`), `drain`/`update` are reserved. No shell or free-form verb (R-4). |
| `config_version` | 16-hex opaque digest of capabilities, tools, concurrency, execution mode, operator config, presented-key expiry and assigned zones (+ each zone's `updated_at`). Not `sensors.updated_at`: every heartbeat and every authentication rewrites it. Foundation for V6 (config drift). |

**Opt-in where v1 bytes or codes would change.** An idle v1 sensor's
response stays byte-identical (`flow.golden`). Two hints cannot meet that and
are sent only to a sensor that sends `X-OpenCTEM-Sensor-Features: doorbell`:
`config_version` (present on every heartbeat) and the disabled-sensor answer.
A disabled sensor cannot authenticate, so `pause` would never be reachable;
the doorbell-aware sensor gets `200 {"actions":["pause"]}` on exactly
`POST /api/v1/agent/heartbeat`, every other route still answers 401, and a v1
sensor still gets 401 — the agent's start-up connection test is a heartbeat
and exits on 401, which must not turn into a start against a disabled
identity. Revoked sensors and expired keys get 401 everywhere.

**Light.** One statement per heartbeat, `LIMIT 100`, 1 s timeout; a failure
or timeout is logged and the heartbeat answers 200 without query hints. On
100k commands (worst case: idle sensor, 15k pending jobs for others) it costs
2.4 ms / 194 buffers versus 4.6 ms / 4 190 buffers for one poll; the existing
partial indexes `idx_commands_pending_poll` / `idx_commands_pending_unassigned`
serve it, no new index (details and plans: `docs/architecture/sensors.md`).

**SDK side (next).** React to `pending_jobs > 0` by polling at once; adopt
`next_heartbeat_seconds`; act on `actions`; with hints present, drop the
fixed 30 s poll; with hints absent (older server), keep today's behaviour.

**v2 follow-up: long-poll.** The doorbell still has up to one interval of
latency (5–30 s). Protocol v2 (§4b P10, "HTTPS long-poll kept") replaces it
with `GET /api/v2/sensor/wait?since=<cursor>`: the server holds the request
(≤ 55 s, under common proxy idle timeouts) and returns as soon as a command is
pinned to or claimable by the sensor, an action is raised, or the
config version changes; a timeout returns the same body as an idle heartbeat.
Wake-ups come from a per-tenant Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` (or Redis pub/sub)
channel published on command insert/unpin, zone assignment change and
sensor status change, with a per-sensor in-process waiter so one notification
wakes only the sensors whose doorbell count could have changed; the
`pending_jobs` query from v1 runs only on wake-up. It is signed like every v2
request (P2), the response carries signed actions (K1), and `GET
/api/v2/sensor/config` serves the configuration `config_version` points at.
v1 sensors keep the doorbell; nothing in v1 changes.
Results pushed over v2 follow [RFC-026](RFC-026-sensor-results-ingest.md);
a v2 report reaching a final state is one more wake-up reason for `wait`, so
the sensor does not have to poll the report's status resource.


### 9.2b Active suppression rules for the sensor (protocol v1 additive route)

`GET /api/v1/agent/suppressions` (sensor API-key auth, `legacyv1.SuppressionsPath`)
returns the approved, unexpired suppression rules of the sensor's tenant as
`{"count": n, "rules": [{rule_id, tool_name, path_pattern, asset_id, expires_at}]}`,
for the sensor-side security gate (`-fail-on`). Additive under C1: a new route,
no existing route or shape changes.

**Why.** sdk-go called the user route `GET /api/v1/suppressions/active` with the
sensor key. That route sits behind JWT auth and `suppressions:read`, so every
sensor got 401, the SDK swallowed it, and the CI gate never applied a
suppression (found by the 2026-10 sensor connection matrix). Ingest applies
suppressions server-side regardless; this route only lets the gate agree with
the platform. Making the user route accept sensor keys was rejected: sensor
keys work only under `/api/v1/agent/*` (C-2).

**Contract.** Tenant from the sensor identity only; a platform sensor (no
tenant) gets 403. When the suppressions module is disabled for the tenant the
list is empty (200), so a gate degrades to "nothing suppressed". A server
without the route answers 404; the SDK treats any failure as "no rules", as
it always has.

### 9.3 Rollout

| Step | Change | Breaks anything? |
|---|---|---|
| R0 | UI and docs rename: *Settings → Sensors* (Scanners · Agents · Collectors · Scan zones · Networks); `/agents` redirects; role shown from the server-derived mapping. | No (UI only) |
| R1 | API: `role` + `deployment` columns backfilled; optional heartbeat fields; protocol advertisement; fleet version inventory; management responses gain `role`. | No (additive) |
| R2 | SDK minor release: aliases, role/feature/manifest reporting when the server advertises v2, signature verification when present. Our agent bumps to it. | No (opt-in) |
| R3 | Security switches: per-sensor "signature required", tenant "require guarded scanners for private targets", platform minimum protocol. Defaults keep v1 working; operators raise them when their fleet is upgraded. | Only when an operator raises the minimum |

### 9.4 What gets renamed: inventory, risks and handling

Inventory taken 2026-10-01 on develop and live. The "keep" decisions in this
table were **superseded by 9.5 (complete rename)**; the risk and handling
columns still apply.

| Layer | Today | Decision | Risk if renamed outright | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI labels, menus, docs, glossary | "Agents" pages (24 UI files, ~1,400 mentions) | **Rename** to Sensors / Scanners / Agents / Collectors | Users lose their bearings; bookmarks to `/agents` break; screenshots in docs go stale | `/agents` redirects; "Sensors (formerly Agents)" for two releases; glossary page; release notes |
| Management REST API | `/api/v1/agents` (UI + customer automation) | **Add `/api/v1/sensors`** (same handlers); `/agents` kept, marked deprecated | Customer scripts and integrations break | Alias for at least two major versions; `Deprecation` / `Sunset` headers (RFC 9745 / 8594); OpenAPI documents both |
| Sensor protocol (SDK ↔ API) | `/api/v1/agent/*`, `/api/v1/agent/credentials` | **Keep** (protocol v1 frozen, C1); v2 introduces `/api/v2/sensor/*` together with request signing | Every deployed sensor and SDK stops working | Rename only at the v2 boundary, where sensors opt in anyway |
| Permissions | `agents:read/write/delete`, `agents:commands:*` (18 role grants live; also stored in `oct_` API-key scopes and custom roles) | **Add `sensors:*`**, migrate grants and key scopes, accept both during the transition, drop `agents:*` later (contract migration) | Custom roles and API keys silently lose access; Go↔DB permission catalog test fails | Additive seed migration copies every grant and key scope; permission check resolves the old id to the new one; catalog test updated in the same PR; removal only after a release with zero `agents:*` use |
| Database tables and columns | `agents`, `agent_api_keys`; `agent_id` in 9 tables (`commands`, `findings`, `scan_sessions`, `ingest_jobs`, `pipeline_runs`, `step_runs`, `tool_executions`, `runtime_telemetry_events`) + `commands.platform_agent_id`, `scans.agent_preference` | **Keep.** Documented as "the sensor registry" | Rolling deploy breaks (old pods query old names); ~5,400 Go references and raw SQL; FK/index/trigger names; schema-drift checks; customer BI queries | Add `role`, `deployment` columns only (§9.1). If a rename is ever wanted, do it with expand-contract (rename + compatibility view) in its own release |
| API Go code | ~5,400 mentions | **Keep**; new code (zones, policy, health) uses sensor terms; type alias `Sensor = Agent` where it helps readability | Huge diff, merge conflicts with every open branch, regressions for no user value | Glossary in the architecture doc and CLAUDE.md so the mixed vocabulary is explained |
| SDK exported identifiers | 19 types/functions with "Agent" | **Aliases only** (C5); deprecate in a later minor; remove only in a major | Third-party code stops compiling | `type SensorRuntime = Agent` etc.; `// Deprecated:` with the replacement; changelog |
| Agent binary, repo, images | `openctemio/agent`, `ghcr.io/openctemio/agent:{ci,full,slim,nuclei,trivy,semgrep,gitleaks,platform}` — **`:ci` is referenced from customer CI pipelines** via our GitHub/GitLab templates | **Keep**; optionally also publish the same digest as `openctemio/sensor:*` | Customer pipelines fail on next run; Helm charts and install scripts break | Dual-publish identical digests if a new name is wanted; never remove the old tags |
| Environment variables, CLI flags | `API_URL`, `API_KEY`, `AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS`, `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | **Keep**; accept `SENSOR_*` aliases later (old name wins on conflict, warning logged) | Sensors start with defaults (e.g. private targets suddenly blocked or allowed) | Alias table in one place in the SDK; startup log shows which name was used |
| Helm values | `agent.*` (72 mentions) | **Keep**; add `sensor.*` alias later | Existing values files silently ignored | Chart maps both; `helm lint` test for each |
| Audit action ids, event types | `agent.created`, `agent.key_regenerated`, … (14 ids) in the hash-chained audit log, SIEM rules, notifications | **Keep the ids**; show "Sensor …" labels in the UI | Customer SIEM rules stop matching; queries over history split in two | Ids are machine contracts; only labels change |
| Log fields, metrics | `agent_id` in logs and dashboards | **Keep** | Dashboards and alerts break | — |
| CTIS report schema | No agent fields | Nothing to do | — | — |
| Legacy `type` value `sensor` ("EASM sensor") | Accepted by API | Mapped to role `scanner` (§9.1); never emitted again | Ambiguity between the umbrella term and a legacy value | Unit test: the literal `sensor` is only accepted as a legacy `type` input, never produced |
| The word "agent" itself | Today means "our runtime" | From now on means the **endpoint role** | Old docs and conversations read wrongly | Glossary; docs updated in R0; "formerly" labels |

**Process risks.** One big rename PR would collide with every open branch; it
is split into the R0–R3 steps (§9.3), each small and reversible. The
compatibility CI job (C8) runs the previous released agent and SDK against
every API change, so an accidental break of the frozen surface fails the
build instead of a customer deployment.

### 9.5 Decision update: complete rename (supersedes the "keep" rows of 9.4)

The product owner asked for a complete move to *sensor*, inside the code as
well, with no permanent internal aliases. That is feasible and is the plan.
The only things that keep an old name are those that **cannot** change without
breaking something already deployed or rewriting history, and each is
time-boxed and measured.

**Feasibility, proven by a spike on develop (2026-10-01).** A two-step,
type-checked rename:

1. Move the package directory and rewrite import paths, keeping the old
   identifier as an import alias, so the tree compiles at every step
   (`pkg/domain/agent` → `pkg/domain/sensor`, 38 importing files: build and vet pass).
2. Rename identifiers with `gopls rename`, which resolves objects by type, so a
   local variable named `agent` is never touched: 32 per-file package renames
   with 0 conflicts in 92 s; type `Agent` → `Sensor` in 2 s, 189 references
   updated; build and vet pass.

`rsc.io/rf` was evaluated and rejected for this: it cannot move a whole
package and needs ~2 min per invocation on this tree.

**How the complete rename is done**

| Layer | Complete rename | What keeps the old name, and why | Safety net |
|---|---|---|---|
| API Go code (~5,400 mentions, 29 files with *agent* in the path) | Every package, file, type, function, method, field, constant, variable, comment and log field. Driven by a committed, re-runnable script (directory moves + `gopls rename` per symbol + `goimports`), as a mechanical commit separate from any logic change. | Only the **legacy wire adapter** for protocol v1 (`/api/v1/agent/*`, the `type` values old SDKs send), isolated in one package named for what it is. | Build, vet, lint, full unit + integration tests; a CI rule that fails on any new `agent` identifier outside an allow-list (legacy adapter, migrations, the endpoint-agent role). |
| Database | Tables `agents` → `sensors`, `agent_api_keys` → `sensor_api_keys`; columns `agent_id` → `sensor_id` in the 9 tables, `commands.platform_agent_id`, `scans.agent_preference`, `sensors.is_platform_agent`; 28 indexes, 16 constraints, the trigger, the RLS policy, the row types; the 3 PL/pgSQL functions rewritten (their bodies are text). Stored values carrying the vocabulary converted in the same migration (permissions, module id, event types, scopes, settings, provenance). One migration: **000230**. | Nothing in the schema. **No compatibility views** (decided 2026-10-01): views could stand in for the two renamed tables but not for the columns renamed inside shared tables (`commands`, `findings`, …), so an old binary would still break; the upgrade is stop-old → migrate → start-new. History that is append-only or hash-chained keeps its old values (audit, asset state history). | Postgres carries policies, FKs and indexes across renames by OID; the existing **SQL schema-drift** CI check validates every query against the migrated schema, so a missed SQL string fails CI; migration tested up/down (byte-identical schema round-trip) and on a seeded pre-rename database (`TestSensorRenameUpgrade`). |
| Permissions | `agents:*` → `sensors:*` renamed **in place** in the catalog, every role grant (18 live) and every `oct_` API-key scope, in one data migration; Go constants and UI constants in the same change. | Nothing. Access tokens in flight are re-resolved from the database on each request (`EnrichPermissions`). | Permission catalog sync test (Go ≡ DB); scratch-DB check that every role and key keeps the same effective access. |
| Management REST API | `/api/v1/sensors` is the API. | `/api/v1/agents` answers with **308 redirect** + `Deprecation`/`Sunset` headers for a fixed window, then 410. | OpenAPI contract check; usage of the old path is counted and shown to the operator. |
| Sensor protocol | Protocol v2 uses `/api/v2/sensor/*` and sensor terms throughout. | Protocol v1 (`/api/v1/agent/*`) is **still served** by the legacy adapter, because sensors and SDKs already deployed speak it. Retired when the operator raises the minimum protocol (C7); usage per tenant is visible on the Sensors page. | Compatibility CI job runs the last released agent/SDK against every API build (C8). |
| SDK (`sdk-go`) | All 19 *Agent* identifiers renamed in the next release (pre-1.0, so a breaking minor is allowed by semver); a **migration codemod** (`sensor-migrate`, built on the same `gopls` approach) ships with it so third parties upgrade with one command. | Old SDK versions already compiled into deployed sensors keep working over protocol v1. | Release notes + migration guide; conformance suite (D23). |
| Sensor binary, repository, images | Repository `openctemio/agent` → `openctemio/sensor` (GitHub keeps redirects for clones and links); binary `openctemio-sensor`; images `openctemio/sensor:{ci,full,slim,…}`. | Existing `openctemio/agent:*` tags stay **pullable but frozen** (no new versions), so customer CI pipelines keep running the last version until they switch; the frozen image logs a one-line notice. | Our GitHub/GitLab CI templates switch to the new image in the same release. |
| Environment variables, CLI flags, Helm | `SENSOR_*`, `--sensor-*`, Helm values `sensor.*` (chart major version). | Old names are **migrated, not refused** (product owner, 2026-10-01): the new binary and chart read the old `AGENT_*` / `--agent-*` / `agent.*` names when the new ones are unset, with a warning naming both; they refuse to start or render **only when an old and a new name are set to different values**, never silently picking one (e.g. private targets suddenly blocked or allowed). The API server's own `AGENT_*` settings already follow this rule. | Startup test per variable (mapping, warning, conflict); `helm template` tests for old values (mapped + notice) and conflicting values (fails with the keys). |
| UI | Routes, feature folders, components, permission constants, copy: `/sensors` everywhere. | `/agents` URLs redirect (bookmarks). | Type-check, lint, vitest, route tests. |
| Audit log | New events are `sensor.*`. | Historical `agent.*` rows stay as written: the audit log is hash-chained and tamper-evident, so rewriting history would break its integrity by design. Queries and filters treat both as the same event family. | Chain verification unchanged. |
| Docs | Rewritten; a glossary explains the change once. | — | Link checker. |

#### Upgrade migration for existing installations

Existing installations have run with the *agent* names for a long time. Every
layer upgrades through the mechanism that installation already uses, with no
manual data surgery; anything that cannot be rewritten is read under both
names.

| Layer | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Database schema and stored data | Migration 000230 runs in the normal `migrate up` (compose migrate step, Helm pre-upgrade hook, `migrate` binary). Idempotent (every step checks state first; safe to re-run or to resume), lands correctly when an install skips several versions (applied in order), exact inverse `.down.sql`. Converts permissions in every role, group, permission set and `oct_` key scope (effective access unchanged), the module id and tenant toggles, notification event types and their references (webhooks, notification extensions, muted types), sensor key scopes, pipeline and Tenable settings, server-written provenance. Keeps hash-chained audit rows and append-only asset state history as written and reads both spellings as one family. Full list: [contract §8](RFC-023-sensor-rename-contract.md#8-stored-values-migration-000230-converts). | **Done** (api) |
| Upgrade confirmation | `server -sensor-upgrade-check` prints every probe and exits non-zero on leftovers; a cheap subset runs at every API start and logs a warning per leftover. | **Done** (api) |
| API server configuration | `AGENT_*` → `SENSOR_*` (10 variables): new name first, old name applied with a startup warning, startup fails only on conflicting values. Template directory `configs/agent-templates` → `configs/sensor-templates` with a fallback to the old path when only it exists. | **Done** (api) |
| Management API clients | `/api/v1/agents/*` answers 308 to `/api/v1/sensors/*` with `Deprecation` / `Sunset` (2027-04-01) headers, counted and logged; scan-config files exported before the rename still import. | **Done** (api) |
| Deployed sensor binaries | Protocol v1 stays served unchanged (golden-tested), so nothing has to be upgraded on the day. The new binary **migrates** its own configuration: old `AGENT_*` env vars and `--agent-*` flags are mapped exactly to the new names with a startup warning naming each; it refuses to start only when an old and a new name are set to different values. The credentials file `~/.openctem/agent-credentials.json` is moved atomically to `~/.openctem/sensor-credentials.json` with mode 0600: write the new file to a temp path, fsync, rename, read it back and verify, and only then remove the old file (an interrupted start loses nothing; an explicit `--credentials` path is used as is). | Pending (agent repo) |
| Helm | Chart major version accepts the old `agent.*` values through a mapping and prints the mapping in `helm upgrade` NOTES; rendering fails with a message naming the keys only when `agent.*` and `sensor.*` set conflicting values. The API env block switches to `SENSOR_*` (the API still reads `AGENT_*`). | Pending (helm-charts) |
| Docker images | `openctemio/sensor:*` published; existing `openctemio/agent:*` tags stay pullable (frozen, with a one-line notice), so customer pipelines pinned to `:ci` keep running. | Pending (agent repo) |
| sdk-go | Next release renames the 19 *Agent* identifiers and ships the `sensor-migrate` codemod (type-aware, gopls-based); SDK versions already compiled into deployed sensors keep working over protocol v1. | Pending (sdk-go) |
| UI | Implements [the contract](RFC-023-sensor-rename-contract.md): `/api/v1/sensors`, `sensors:*`, module `sensors`, renamed fields, both audit spellings labelled. Bookmarked `/agents` routes redirect to `/sensors`; per-browser state keyed by *agent* (localStorage: table settings, filters, selected tabs) is migrated to the new keys on first load and the old keys removed. Must deploy together with the API release (the API answers `sensors:*` only). | Pending (ui) |
| Protocol v1 | Served by `pkg/sensorproto/legacyv1` until the operator raises the minimum sensor protocol (C7). | **Done** (api) |

**Order** (each step shippable, nothing deployed breaks): API (schema +
code + permissions + legacy v1 adapter) → SDK release with codemod → sensor
binary/images/repo → Helm chart major → UI → docs → retire v1 and the
`/agents` redirect on the operator's schedule. Only two API PRs are open today,
so the mechanical rename commit lands with minimal conflict; any branch opened
later rebases by re-running the committed script.

## 10. Sensor fleet security: use cases and controls

The platform must always know what every sensor is doing, notice when one goes
quiet or misbehaves, and keep a compromised sensor from reaching anything
beyond its own narrow lane, in both directions (sensor → platform and
platform → sensor). Each use case below names the control that answers it.

### 10.1 Visibility: the platform always knows the state of every sensor

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | A sensor stops connecting (crash, network cut, host powered off) | Heartbeat at poll cadence (the server advises the cadence, §9.2a); states **online → late → offline → lost** after N missed intervals; per-tenant alert (in-app + notification channels) at *offline*, escalation at *lost*; fleet health on the Sensors page. |
| V2 | A sensor is connected but does no work ("silent") | Per-job lease + progress watchdog: no progress before lease expiry ⇒ job re-queued to another scanner in the zone, sensor marked *degraded*; job success-rate per sensor tracked. |
| V3 | A zone has no healthy scanner | Coverage alert per zone; New-scan preview shows which targets would be skipped. |
| V4 | Assets stop being scanned | Freshness SLO per zone (assets not scanned in N days) with alert (extends RFC-007 coverage stats). |
| V5 | Sensor runs an outdated or vulnerable version | Heartbeat reports SDK/protocol/tool versions; platform advisories + minimum version (C7); *upgrade required* flag. |
| V6 | Sensor configuration drifts from what the platform set | Heartbeat carries a hash of effective config (allowed ranges, tools, limits, template set); mismatch ⇒ *config drift* flag and alert. |
| V7 | Sensor clock is wrong (breaks signatures and expiries) | Skew measured on every signed request; warn at 1 min, refuse at 5 min. |
| V8 | Fleet inventory goes stale | Sensors with no heartbeat for 30 days are auto-disabled (keys revoked), and reported for decommission. |

### 10.2 Control: the platform governs sensor behaviour

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| K1 | Stop a sensor now | Typed, signed remote actions: **pause / resume / drain / quarantine / revoke / rotate key / force re-enroll / apply config / update**. No shell or free-form command exists. v1 rings the unsigned subset `pause / resume / drain / rotate_key / update` on the heartbeat (§9.2a). |
| K2 | Stop all scanning during an incident | **Kill switch** per tenant and platform-wide: no new jobs, running jobs cancelled at next poll. |
| K3 | Limit how hard a sensor scans | Policy per sensor/zone: allowed tools, max concurrency, packets-per-second / intensity, **scan windows and blackout windows**; enforced by the SDK locally and by dispatch. |
| K4 | A job must not run late or forever | Job `exp` in the signed envelope, max runtime, cancel propagation; expired jobs are never executed after a reconnect. |
| K5 | Change what a sensor may do | Role/capability approval per role (D18a); removing a tool from the manifest or policy takes effect at the next poll. |

### 10.3 Containment: a compromised sensor cannot spread to the platform

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Attacker steals a sensor's identity | Private key never leaves the host (P1); request signing (P2) means captured traffic is useless; identity bound to host fingerprint ⇒ **the same identity used from two hosts or a new host fingerprint ⇒ quarantine**; unusual source IP/ASN ⇒ alert. |
| C-2 | Compromised sensor calls other APIs | Sensor credentials only work on the sensor route group (no user/admin/tenant-data APIs); it can read only its own jobs and config; tenant from identity, never the body. |
| C-3 | Compromised sensor floods or crashes the API | Separate rate limits, concurrency and quotas for sensor traffic (bulkhead from user traffic), limits applied **before** decompression; bounded decompression everywhere (the ingest-chunk zstd bomb, api#554); per-tenant asset/finding quotas. |
| C-4 | Compromised sensor poisons data | Push scopes (D21): reportable tool names must be in its manifest/job; results outside its zone or job are quarantined; mass auto-resolve or zero-finding "blinding" reports are held for review; provenance on every record. |
| C-5 | Clean up after a compromise | **Purge or roll back everything a sensor wrote in a time window** (findings created/resolved, assets, evidence), driven by provenance; findings it auto-resolved are reopened. |
| C-6 | Sensor-supplied content attacks users or the server | All sensor strings are untrusted: escaped in the UI, markdown sanitised; the server never fetches a sensor-supplied URL except through the SSRF-guarded client; filenames and ids are validated. |
| C-7 | Compromised sensor harvests credentials | Credentials released per job, only for in-range targets, envelope-encrypted to that sensor (D12); custom sensors never get control-plane credentials; every release audited; SSH keys preferred over passwords. |
| C-8 | Compromised sensor forges validation or job outcomes | Evidence and outcomes accepted only for a job assigned to that sensor and still open; state transitions validated (no "fail" after "complete"). |

### 10.4 Reverse containment: a compromised platform cannot weaponise sensors

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| R-1 | Platform tells a scanner to scan something outside its network | Operator-held local allow-list intersected with the signed manifest (D8); built-in deny list (loopback, link-local/IMDS, `::/128`, control plane) on resolved, pinned IPs. |
| R-2 | Forged or replayed jobs | JWS envelopes, offline root key, nonce + expiry, addressed to one sensor (P5, P6). |
| R-3 | Malicious update or template | TUF-signed updates and templates with rollback protection (P7); signed releases (P8). |
| R-4 | Platform asks for shell access | Not part of the protocol; the SDK has no such verb. |

### 10.5 Detecting a compromised sensor

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Binary or tools replaced on the host | Sensor reports the digest of its binary and tools; mismatch with the signed release ⇒ quarantine (TPM-based attestation later). |
| D-2 | Sensor lies about results ("blinding") | **Canary jobs**: the platform periodically schedules a scan of a known canary target with known findings; a scanner that misses them is flagged. Cross-check when two scanners cover the same zone. |
| D-3 | Abnormal behaviour | Baselines per sensor: auth failures, renew rate, job volume, result volume, new-asset rate; deviations raise alerts and can auto-quarantine. |

### 10.6 Disconnection and recovery

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| N-1 | Network partition mid-job | Results buffered locally (encrypted, bounded, file mode 0600), retried with `Idempotency-Key`; the platform re-routes after lease expiry; duplicates are dropped. |
| N-2 | Platform unavailable | Exponential backoff with jitter; the sensor never starts work that was not assigned and signed. |
| N-3 | Key expires while offline | Short grace window for renewal signed by the old key; otherwise re-enrollment with approval. |

### 10.7 Lifecycle, audit and response

| # | Use case | Control |
|---|---|---|
| L-1 | New sensor appears | Single-use enrollment token, approval before any job (D10). |
| L-2 | Sensor decommissioned | Revoke keys, delete released credentials, keep provenance for history. |
| L-3 | Everything must be reviewable | Every enrollment, approval, policy change, remote action, job signature, credential release, quarantine and purge goes to the tamper-evident audit log, exportable to SIEM. |
| L-4 | Incident response | Runbook built into the UI: **quarantine → revoke → purge window → re-enroll**, with the affected data listed. |

### 10.8 Findings from the 2026-10-01 platform ↔ SDK review (to fix)

| Sev | Side | Finding | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| HIGH | api | Ingest chunk zstd decompression bomb (any agent key could OOM the shared API) | **fixed, api#554** |
| HIGH | sdk | `DefaultCommandExecutor` passes server-supplied targets to scanners with no target validation or path confinement (third-party users exposed; our agent wraps it) | 0 |
| MED | sdk | gitleaks findings send the **full plaintext secret** as the snippet | 0 |
| MED | api | Heartbeat rewrites the whole agent row (can undo an admin revoke or key change) | 0 |
| MED | api | Auto-resolve trusts the reported tool name; any agent key can resolve another tool's findings | 0 (D21) |
| MED | api | Validation evidence accepted for any finding without an assigned validate job | 0 |
| MED | api | Ingest rate limiter runs after decompression; no per-tenant asset/finding quota | 0 |
| MED | sdk | `pkg/platform` targets routes that do not exist on the API; its checks never run | 0 |
| MED | agent | Per-tool images download binaries without checksums, run as root, no provenance/SBOM | 4 (P8) |
| MED | sdk | Template cache path traversal (`TemplateType`, tenant id) | 0 |
| LOW | both | Unbounded response reads; command expiry dropped by the client; scheme-downgrade redirect keeps the key; non-atomic key save; child processes inherit secrets; API key visible in `ps`; chunk DB permissions; regenerate does not revoke renewed keys; `oct_` scope escalation; missing audit events; key scopes unenforced; `Fail` state checks; unvalidated `X-Request-ID`; global 10 MB limit masks the ingest limit | 0–2 |

## 11. Security notes

- The strongest guarantee is layer 3 with an operator-set local allow-list: it
  holds even if the control plane is fully compromised. Layers 1–2 are routing
  correctness; signing (D9) protects against path attackers and database
  tampering, not against an attacker holding the signing key.
- Zone ranges are validated: no `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0` for private zones, no
  overlap with the built-in deny list, bounded size for scanner capacity.
- Credentials are never logged, never returned by the API, and (T2) leave the
  control plane only inside one job's envelope for in-range targets.
- Everything here is tenant-scoped; a zone or scanner id from another tenant is
  rejected in SQL, not only in handlers.

## 12. Open questions (answered for Phase 1)

1. Should a public target in a tenant with zones but no internet-facing scanner
   fall back to platform scanners if the tenant opted in, or be skipped? (Proposal:
   skipped unless the tenant explicitly enabled shared scanners.)
   **Answer:** it never goes to platform scanners implicitly (D14). With a
   default zone it goes to that zone's sensors, and waits there if none is
   online. Without a default zone it is dispatched as before zones, to any
   tenant sensor; the coverage view warns about it
   (`public_addresses_without_default_zone`). Opting in to shared scanners is
   Phase 4 and will be explicit.
2. Domain/hostname routing: route by resolved IP only (proposal), or also allow
   suffix rules (`*.corp.example`) on zones?
   **Answer:** resolved IP only, as proposed. The platform resolves the name at
   trigger time; the narrowest zone holding any resolved address wins; a name
   resolving to a private address outside every zone, to the deny list, or not
   resolving at all is reported as uncovered with the reason and never sent.
   Suffix rules can be added later without changing this behaviour.
