## 1. Answer in short

A **retest** re-runs the exact check that produced a finding — for Phase 1 the
nuclei template (`rule_id`) against the finding's own target — **plus a
reachability probe of the same target**, and moves the finding on the combined
result:

| Template re-run | Target reachable? | Retest outcome | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| matched | any | **still present** | open: unchanged · resolved: **reopened (regression)** · `fix_applied`: back to `in_progress` · `validated_fixed`: `confirmed` |
| no match | yes | **fixed** | open → `resolved` (`resolution_method = retest_verified`) · resolved: unchanged (re-confirmed) |
| no match | no / unknown | **unknown** | unchanged; the retest records *target unreachable* |
| inconclusive / error / no result | any | **unknown** | unchanged |

A tenant can turn on **auto-retest** (default **off**): a scheduler re-checks
the tenant's eligible open and recently-fixed findings once per interval
(default 24 h), within a per-tenant daily cap and an in-flight cap, claimed once
per tick so several API replicas never double-fire. A user with
`findings:verify` can press **Retest now** on one finding.

Every status change a retest makes is written to the finding's activity trail
with the actor **`system: retest`** (and, for a manual retest, who asked), and
every request is audit-logged.

Independently of retests, a **scan that re-detects** a finding a person had
resolved already reopens it on develop (the 2026-07 "human-fix regressions don't
auto-reopen" gap is closed at the SQL level). Phase 1 closes what is left of
that gap: the reopen now remembers **who resolved it and how**, and a scan that
re-detects a `validated_fixed` finding refutes the downgrade.

## 2. Current state (verified 2026-10-03, `develop` 2c3919d4, sensor `main` 9b65e57 = v0.7.0)

### 2.1 What happens when a scanner reports a resolved finding again

Ingest (`internal/app/ingest/processor_findings.go`, step 3b) calls
`AutoReopenByFingerprintsBatch` (`internal/infra/postgres/finding_repository.go`).

| Finding state when the scan sees it again | Result today |
|---|---|
| `resolved` by auto-resolve (`resolution = auto_fixed`) | reopened to `confirmed` |
| `resolved` by a person (any other `resolution`, or NULL) | reopened to `confirmed` (fixed before this RFC; DB test `finding_reopen_human_resolved_db_test.go`) |
| `verified` (pentest) | reopened to `confirmed` |
| `false_positive`, `accepted`, `duplicate`, `accepted_risk`, suppressed (`resolution = suppressed`) | never reopened (deliberate dispositions) |
| `fix_applied` | **stays `fix_applied`** — only enriched |
| `validated_fixed` | **stays `validated_fixed`** — only enriched |

Trigger `000199` sets `is_regression`, `reopen_count`, `last_reopened_at` on any
resolved/verified → open move. What is still wrong:

- **Who fixed it is lost.** The reopen sets `resolved_by`, `resolution`,
  `resolution_method` to NULL, and the activity row records only
  `{"reason": "finding_detected_again"}` — no previous status, no previous
  resolver, no scan.
- **`validated_fixed` is never reopened by a scan**, although a scan seeing the
  issue is exactly the evidence that refutes a validation downgrade.
- **`fix_applied` is never moved back** although `RequestVerificationScan` and the
  Jira rescan hook both promise "back to in_progress via the normal ingest
  pipeline". (Left for the owner: §10 D5 — a scan that *started* before the fix
  was claimed can legitimately still see it.)
- **No side effects on reopen:** no notification, no workflow event, no ticket
  comment, and the SLA clock is not restarted (the escalation job then marks a
  reopened finding overdue against its original deadline).

### 2.2 Retest / verify entry points that exist

| Route | Gate | What it really does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /findings/{id}/request-verification` | `findings:write` | `QuickScan` of the **whole asset** with a scanner the user types. Requires `fix_applied`. Not linked back to the finding; nothing reads its `verification-scan` tag. An ad-hoc host scan has no branch, so report-level auto-resolve cannot close the finding, and coverage auto-resolve is `dry_run` by default. **The web offers it in the ⋯ menu for every status except `fix_applied`, where the API refuses it.** |
| `POST /findings/{id}/validate` | `findings:write` | RFC-011 validation: a `validate` command. `nuclei` single-template re-run when the finding has a template/CVE signature and a `validate:nuclei` sensor is online, else a TCP `safe-check`. Outcome applied by `applyOutcomeToFinding`. |
| `POST /findings/actions/fix-applied` | `findings:fix_apply` | marks `fix_applied` and auto-queues validation (proof of fix) |
| pentest `/retests` | pentest perms | manual pentest retest records |

### 2.3 How validation re-checks work, and two defects that matter here

`RunService.ValidateFinding` → `CommandDispatcher.Dispatch` (command type
`validate`, `required_capabilities: ["validate:nuclei"]` or `["validate"]`) → the
sensor (`sensor/internal/executor/validation.go`) runs
`nuclei -u <target> -id <template> -etags dos,fuzz,intrusive,… -rate-limit 20`
or a TCP probe → `Complete` → `triggerValidationEvidence` →
`EvidenceIngestService.Ingest` → `applyOutcomeToFinding`.

- **D-a. An unreachable target reads as "fixed".** nuclei emits nothing and
  exits 0 when the host does not answer, which the sensor reports as
  `not_detected`. `applyOutcomeToFinding` then downgrades an open finding to
  `validated_fixed` (or *resolves* a `fix_applied` one). A down host, a firewall
  change or a sensor in the wrong network zone looks exactly like a fix.
- **D-b. Safe-check answers a different question.** For a `fix_applied` finding,
  a TCP probe that connects ("reachable") is mapped to *"fix did not hold"* and a
  refused connection to *resolved*. Reachability is not the vulnerability.
- Status moves made by `applyOutcomeToFinding` use a nil actor and write **no**
  `finding_activities` row; `/validate` has no rate limit or concurrency cap; and
  validate commands do not carry `scan_zone_id`, so zone routing (RFC-023) does
  not apply to them.

### 2.4 Why a retest cannot be a plain scan Run today

A scan command's payload reaches the scanner through the SDK, which honours only
`allow_interactsh` and `exclude` from `config` (`sdk-go/pkg/core/command_poller.go`;
RFC-038 §3.1 found the same). There is **no way to send a template id in a scan
command**, so a "scan Run with only that template" would run the sensor's full
nuclei set against the asset. That is the cost of a scan for a one-template
question, and coverage auto-resolve (`decideCoverage`) would treat the run as full
coverage of the asset and could close the asset's *other* nuclei findings in
`enforce` mode. The `validate` command, on the other hand, is already a scoped,
single-template, rate-limited, tag-restricted, SSRF-guarded run on the sensor —
it is the deterministic re-check this RFC needs.

## 3. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**

1. Keep finding status true over time: a fixed issue becomes *Fixed* without a
   person, a regression reopens without a person.
2. Never call something fixed that was not observed fixed (unreachable ⇒
   *unknown*, never *fixed*).
3. Bounded load: a tenant cannot use retests to flood a target or to starve
   shared sensors.
4. Every status change attributable (`system: retest`, who asked, which
   template, which commands) and visible on the finding.
5. Reuse the existing transport (commands, leases, capability routing, evidence
   store); no new sensor protocol in Phase 1.

**Non-goals (Phase 1)**

- Retesting finding types without a deterministic single check (SAST/SCA/secrets,
  Tenable, pentest). Their source of truth stays the next full scan.
- A CVE→template resolver for non-nuclei findings (RFC-011.2 open question 1).
- Changing RFC-011.2's validation semantics — Phase 1 only stops its defects
  from touching retest commands (§6.4). Fixing D-a/D-b for `/validate` itself is
  §10 D3.

## 4. Model and states

### 4.1 Retest (one row per attempt, `finding_retests`)

```
            request (manual | auto)
                   │
                   ▼
   ┌────────── pending ──────────┐   two tasks: check (validate:nuclei) + reach (safe-check)
   │                             │
   │ both tasks terminal,        │ deadline passed (30 min) / dispatch failed
   │ or settle on completion     │
   ▼                             ▼
completed{fixed | still_present | unknown}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trigger` | `manual` (Retest now) or `auto` (scheduler) |
| `requested_by` | the user for `manual`, NULL for `auto` |
| `prior_status` / `result_status` | finding status before / after the retest |
| `check_command_id` / `reach_command_id` | the two `validate` commands |
| `template_id`, `target` | exactly what was re-run, against what |
| `outcome`, `reason` | `fixed` / `still_present` / `unknown`, with a human reason (`target unreachable`, `template not installed on the sensor`, `no sensor result before the deadline`, …) |
| `deadline_at` | when a still-pending retest is settled as `unknown` |

A partial unique index allows **one pending retest per finding**: the second
request is refused, a second scheduler cannot queue it again.

### 4.2 Outcome decision (pure function, `pkg/domain/retest`)

```
check = detected                         → still_present
check = not_detected  and reach = detected (reachable)
                                         → fixed
check = not_detected  and reach ≠ detected
                                         → unknown  ("target unreachable")
check ∈ {inconclusive, error, skipped} or no result
                                         → unknown  (summary of the check)
```

The reachability probe is the **guard against D-a**. It is not evidence of the
vulnerability; it only makes "no match" mean something.

### 4.3 Finding transition (pure function)

| Finding status before | fixed | still_present | unknown |
|---|---|---|---|
| `new`, `confirmed`, `in_progress` | → `resolved` | unchanged | unchanged |
| `fix_applied` | → `resolved` (proof of fix) | → `in_progress` | unchanged |
| `validated_fixed` | → `resolved` | → `confirmed` | unchanged |
| `resolved` | unchanged (re-confirmed fixed) | → `confirmed` (**regression**) | unchanged |
| `false_positive`, `accepted`, `duplicate`, pentest states | not eligible — never retested | | |

`resolved` by a retest sets `resolution = "retest: not detected (<template>)"`,
`resolution_method = retest_verified`, `resolved_by` = the requesting user for a
manual retest (they hold `findings:verify`, so this is their verification) and
NULL for an auto retest. A regression reopen goes through the normal transition
(resolved → confirmed), so trigger `000199` counts it.

The transition is decided from the finding's status **at settle time**, read
with the row locked in the same transaction that completes the retest and writes
the activity entry. A person who changed the finding while the retest ran is
therefore respected: a finding they marked `false_positive` is not touched; one
they moved to `fix_applied` gets the proof-of-fix transition. Nothing is
half-applied.

## 5. Which findings qualify

Phase 1 qualifies a finding only when a **deterministic single check** exists and
the platform can address it:

1. `tool_name = 'nuclei'` and `rule_id` is a template id that passes the existing
   template guard (`templateSignatureAllowed`: no path, no `dos`/`fuzz`/
   `intrusive`/`brute-force` marker; the sensor re-checks by tag).
2. status in the eligible set (§4.3); for **auto** retests a `resolved` finding
   qualifies only if it was resolved in the last 90 days.
3. the asset is `active`, network-addressable (domain, subdomain, IP, host,
   service, application, website, …) and passes the **target gate** (§7.2).
4. a `validate:nuclei` sensor is online for the tenant.

Target: the finding's matched-at URL (`file_path`) when its host is the asset's
host; otherwise the asset name. A finding cannot point a retest at a host that is
not its own asset.

Later phases add the other deterministic families, each as its own check kind on
the same model:

| Family | Check | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| nuclei template | `validate:nuclei` single template | **1** |
| open port / service | TCP connect / banner on the recorded port (naabu-style) | 2 |
| TLS / certificate | `tlsx`-style handshake: expiry, chain, protocol, cipher | 2 |
| DNS (dangling CNAME, SPF/DMARC, takeover) | the RFC-036 P1 DNS-only checks, run by the API | 2 |
| CVE from another scanner | CVE→nuclei-template resolver (RFC-011.2 Q1) | 3 |

## 6. Flows

### 6.1 Retest now (manual)

`POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/retest` — `findings:verify`, data-scoped (§8.3).

1. Load the finding **in the caller's tenant** (tenant from the token, never the
   body); check eligibility (§5) → `400` with the reason otherwise.
2. Limits (§8.1): one pending per finding (`409`), cooldown since the last retest
   of this finding, per-asset and per-tenant in-flight caps (`429`).
3. Insert the `pending` row (claims the per-finding slot), then enqueue the two
   `validate` commands carrying `retest_id`. If enqueueing fails the row is
   settled `unknown` (`dispatch failed`) at once.
4. Audit `finding.retest_requested` (user, finding, template, target) and a
   `retest_requested` activity. Respond `202` with the retest.

### 6.2 Result handling

The sensor completes each command as today. In `triggerValidationEvidence`, a
command whose payload carries `retest_id`:

- records its evidence **advisory only** (`IngestAdvisory`: visible in the
  finding's evidence, never applied by `applyOutcomeToFinding` — so D-a/D-b
  cannot touch a retest), then
- asks the retest service to **settle**: when both commands are terminal it
  decides the outcome (§4.2), moves the finding (§4.3), writes a
  `retest_completed` activity with actor `system: retest`, and completes the row.
  Settling is a compare-and-set on `status = 'pending'`, so two replicas that
  receive the two completions at the same moment settle it once.

A failed, expired or never-picked-up command is settled by the scheduler's
sweep: any pending retest whose commands are all terminal, or whose
`deadline_at` passed, is settled (missing results ⇒ `unknown`).

### 6.3 Auto-retest (scheduler)

`RetestScheduler` (controller, every minute, on every replica):

1. **Sweep** stale pending retests (§6.2).
2. For tenants with `settings.retest.auto_enabled = true`, ordered by their
   cursor: **claim** the tenant's tick with a compare-and-set on
   `finding_retest_cursors.next_run_at` (`UPDATE … WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND
   next_run_at IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $seen`, the #847 pattern; a first claim is
   `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). Only the replica that wins queues work.
3. Queue up to `min(daily budget left, in-flight room, per-tick global cap)`
   eligible findings whose last retest is older than the interval (default 24 h),
   oldest-retested first, at most 3 in flight per asset. Each goes through the
   same request path as a manual retest (`trigger = auto`).

Cadence is therefore "every eligible finding about once per interval", bounded
by sensor capacity: when the tenant's in-flight cap is full, the tick queues
nothing and the backlog drains on later ticks; findings whose last retest is
oldest go first, so nothing starves.

### 6.4 Reusing the scan pipeline

In the Scan → Run → Task vocabulary a retest is a **Run with two Tasks**:

- the *Run* is the `finding_retests` row (its own lifecycle, deadline, outcome);
- the *Tasks* are ordinary `commands` rows — the same queue, poll, lease
  (RFC-030 D5 free slots), capability routing (`validate:nuclei`), expiry and
  audit as every scan task.

It deliberately is **not** a `scans`/`pipeline_runs` row in Phase 1 (§2.4: no
template selector on scan commands; coverage auto-resolve hazard). Phase 3, once
RFC-038 delivers typed tool settings (a template list is then a declared, typed
option) and the scans redesign P1 (HA claims, leases) lands, moves retests onto
`pipeline_runs` with `kind = retest`, so they show on the Runs tab, get scan-zone
routing and share `MaxConcurrentRunsPerTenant`. That run must be created with
coverage `partial` so it can never auto-resolve other findings.

### 6.5 Regression reopen from any scan

`AutoReopenByFingerprintsBatch` now:

- also reopens `validated_fixed` → `confirmed` (the scan refutes the downgrade);
- returns, per reopened finding, the **previous status, resolution, resolution
  method and resolver**, read with `FOR UPDATE` in the same statement;
- the `auto_reopened` activity records them (`reason: regression_detected_again`,
  `previous_status`, `previous_resolution`, `previous_resolution_method`,
  `previous_resolved_by`, `scanner`, `scan_id`), so "who fixed it and how" is
  never lost when the row's resolution fields are cleared.

## 7. Interactions

### 7.1 Suppressions, accepted risk, false positives

Never retested, never reopened: `false_positive`, `accepted`, `accepted_risk`,
`duplicate` and `resolved` with `resolution = suppressed` are outside the
eligible set and excluded by the reopen SQL. An expired acceptance re-enters the
eligible set through its existing reopen path.

### 7.2 Scope and ownership (#835)

A retest is an active check, so it passes the same gates as a scan, **failing
closed**:

- the asset must be `active`;
- **scope exclusions** (`scope.Service.ExcludedTargets`, the fail-closed variant
  the scan path uses) — an excluded asset is never retested;
- **attribution** (#835, RFC-036): once `asset_attributions` lands, an asset
  whose state is not `confirmed` (or unset) is not retested. Phase 1 exposes a
  `TargetGate` seam in the retest service; the #835 `ActiveCheckBlocked` check
  plugs into it when that PR merges (direct quick-scan targets are deliberately
  ungated in #835 — retests are not, because the target comes from inventory).
- the sensor's own SSRF guard still applies (`validateScannerTarget`).

### 7.3 SLA clocks

- **fixed** → `resolved`: the SLA stops like any resolve.
- **regression** reopen (scan or retest): **a fresh deadline from the reopen**
  (owner decision D2, Phase 2a), computed by the tenant's SLA policy, with an
  `sla_restarted` activity carrying the reason and the previous deadline. Phase 1
  kept the original deadline, so a regression was overdue the moment it came
  back.
- **unknown** does not touch SLA.

### 7.4 Tickets

Phase 1 writes the activity trail only. Phase 2a comments on the linked Jira
issue on a *fix*, a *regression* and a *rejected fix*, only when the tenant
enabled outbound sync on its integration (the same opt-in as status sync).
Comments are platform-written text with the free-text part capped; they never
carry the evidence body.

### 7.5 Notifications

Phase 2a: a regression and a rejected fix queue the existing `finding_reopened`
event; a retest that resolves a finding queues `finding_fixed`. The tenant's
notification integrations route them by their event filters. One scan reopening
many findings announces at most 50 of them (the SLA restart still covers all).

## 8. Threat model

| # | Threat | Control |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | A tenant forces retests to **DoS a target** (button mashing, a script on the API, auto-retest of thousands of findings on one host) | one pending retest per finding (DB unique index); cooldown per finding (10 min since the last request); at most **3 in flight per asset**; the sensor runs one template at `-rate-limit 20` with `-etags dos,fuzz,intrusive,…`; auto daily cap per tenant (default 200, max 2000) |
| T2 | A tenant **exhausts shared sensors** | per-tenant in-flight cap (**20 manual, 50 auto**); per-tick global cap (100) across tenants, tenants served oldest-cursor first (round-robin); commands carry `required_capabilities` and are claimed through RFC-030 free slots, so a sensor never takes more than it has; tenant sensors only — retests are tenant commands, never platform jobs |
| T3 | Retest **hits something out of scope** | only inventory assets (never a free-form target); target host must equal the asset host; `active` assets only; fail-closed scope exclusions; #835 attribution gate; sensor-side SSRF guard |
| T4 | **Destructive template** via a crafted `rule_id` (findings can be created through the API by `findings:write`) | API template guard (no path, no destructive marker) + sensor tag exclusion and post-match tag check (a mis-tagged destructive match is discarded as inconclusive) |
| T5 | **Unauthorised Retest now / cross-tenant** | `findings:verify` (the same segregation-of-duties permission as resolving) + Layer-2 data scope (`DataScopeGuard` on `/api/v1/findings/{uuid}/…` → 404 out of scope) + tenant taken from the token and every query `WHERE tenant_id = $n`; a finding id from another tenant is "not found" |
| T6 | A **compromised sensor** reports a fake result to close or reopen findings | the result only counts for the command the platform issued to that sensor (existing command ownership); retest evidence is ingested advisory-only; the tenant comes from the command, not the sensor; a fake *fixed* needs both commands, and the reach probe alone cannot close anything |
| T7 | **False "fixed"** from a down host / wrong zone | reach probe guard (§4.2): unreachable ⇒ `unknown` |
| T8 | **Race** with a person changing the finding mid-retest | the transition is decided under the finding's row lock from its status at settle time (§4.3); an ineligible status is never moved |
| T9 | **Double-fire** with several API replicas | tenant tick claimed by compare-and-set; per-finding pending unique index; settle CAS on `pending` |
| T11 | **Ticket / notification injection or flooding** (Phase 2a: a sensor summary flows into the retest reason, which is announced) | announcements are platform-written; the free-text part is flattened to one line of plain text without control characters and capped at 300 characters; ticket comments only when the tenant enabled outbound sync; at most 50 announcements per scan |
| T10 | **Repudiation** | `finding.retest_requested` audit event (who, what, target); `retest_completed` activity with actor `system: retest`, `trigger`, `requested_by`, commands, template; reopen activity keeps the previous resolver |

### 8.1 Limits (Phase 1 constants, all server-side)

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| pending retests per finding | 1 |
| cooldown per finding | 10 min since the last request |
| in flight per asset | 3 |
| in flight per tenant, manual | 20 |
| in flight per tenant, auto | 50 |
| auto daily cap per tenant | setting, default 200, 1–2000 |
| auto interval | setting, default 24 h, 6–168 h |
| global auto queue per tick | 100 |
| retest deadline | 30 min |
| resolved-finding lookback (auto) | 90 days |

### 8.2 Default off

`settings.retest.auto_enabled` defaults to **false** for every tenant until the
scans redesign P1 (HA scheduler claims, leases) lands, per the owner's ordering.
Manual Retest now is available whenever a `validate:nuclei` sensor is online.

### 8.3 Authorization summary

| Action | Gate |
|---|---|
| `POST /findings/{id}/retest` | `findings:verify` + data scope |
| `GET /findings/{id}/retests` | `findings:read` + data scope |
| `GET/PUT /organization/settings/retest` (tenant from the token) | team admin (owner/admin), audited |

## 9. Phased plan

| Phase | Content |
|---|---|
| **P1 (#867)** | `finding_retests` + cursors (migration 000327); domain decision/transition; retest service (eligibility, gates, limits, dispatch, settle, sweep); Retest now + list routes; settings `retest` (default off) + endpoint; `RetestScheduler` with claim-once; advisory ingest of retest evidence; scan regression reopen keeps the previous resolver and reopens `validated_fixed`; web: Retest now button and last-retest status on the finding page and drawer |
| **P2a (#881, owner decisions D2–D4)** | fresh SLA on every regression, scan or retest, with an `sla_restarted` activity (reason, previous deadline; migration 000328); `/validate` verdict rule acts only on exploitability-grade evidence (safe-check never moves a finding, a nuclei miss needs `reachable`); proof of fix on `fix_applied` (and on Jira "Done") is a `proof_of_fix` retest, else the validation re-check; "Request verification scan" retired (route, service, adapter, web); ticket comment (opt-in Jira outbound) + `finding_fixed` / `finding_reopened` notification on a fix, regression or rejected fix, capped at 50 per scan |
| P2b | port/service, TLS and DNS check kinds; web settings page for auto-retest and an auto-retest column/filter |
| P3 | retests as `pipeline_runs(kind = retest)` with scan-zone routing and coverage `partial`, once RFC-038 typed settings and scans P1 land; CVE→template resolver; asset-group-scoped auto-retest policies |

## 10. Owner decisions — approved 2026-10-03

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Clean retest of an open finding | **Resolves it** (`resolution_method = retest_verified`). Shipped in P1 (#867). |
| D2 | SLA on a regression | **Fresh SLA deadline** from the reopen, computed by the tenant's SLA policy; the reason and the previous deadline are recorded on the finding's activity. Phase 2. |
| D3 | `/validate` defects D-a / D-b | **Fix them**: an unreachable host is unknown, never fixed; a safe-check (reachability) result never moves a finding. Phase 2. |
| D4 | "Request verification scan" | **Retired** in favour of Retest now. Phase 2. |
| D5 | `fix_applied` re-detected by a scan | **Left to retest and proof of fix** (no change to ingest). |
| D6 | Auto-retest default | **Off** for every tenant; turned on for new tenants after scans P1 (HA claims, leases) lands. |
| D7 | Limits | **Kept as in §8.1**: 1 pending per finding, 10 min cooldown, 3 per asset, 20 manual / 50 auto per tenant. |

Phase 2 also adds the ticket comment and the notification on a regression or a
fix (§7.4, §7.5).

## 11. Alternatives considered

- **Scoped scan Run** (QuickScan of the asset with nuclei): runs the full
  template set (no template selector on scan commands), costs a scan per
  question, and coverage auto-resolve could close unrelated findings. Rejected
  for P1; P3 once typed settings exist.
- **Reuse `/validate` as is:** unreachable ⇒ "fixed" (D-a), safe-check semantics
  (D-b), no limits, no actor. Rejected; retest reuses its transport, not its
  verdict rule.
- **A new sensor command `retest`:** cleaner wire, but needs an sdk-go release
  and a sensor bump for every tenant, while `validate:nuclei` already ships in
  sensor v0.7.0. Rejected for P1.
