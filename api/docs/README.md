### Getting Started
- [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) - Prerequisites, installation, quick start

### Architecture
- [Overview](architecture/overview.md) - Tech stack, system diagram, design principles
- [Clean Architecture](architecture/clean-arch.md) - Layer details & dependencies
- [Project Structure](architecture/project-structure.md) - Complete file structure
- [Notification System](architecture/notification-system.md) - Real-time alerts, providers, async patterns
- [External Attack Surface Management](architecture/easm.md) - EASM pipeline (seeds → passive collectors on the API → attribution with evidence and confidence → active steps on sensors → observations and diffs), what is built vs planned, known limits (RFC-036)
- [Change Detection](architecture/change-detection.md) - What changed in the attack surface: state history views, `asset_discovered` / `scan_completed` triggers, throttled new-internet-facing-asset notification
- [Scan Orchestration](architecture/scan-orchestration.md) - Pipeline execution, agent coordination
- [CTEM Program Metrics](architecture/program-metrics.md) - MTTD for new internet-facing assets, MTTR for validated exposures, owner acceptance rate: exact definitions, tenant scoping, "—" for not measurable, and why time-to-break attack paths is not computed
- [Scoping Overview](architecture/scoping-overview.md) - `GET /scoping/summary` readiness counts (exact definitions, tenant-wide like Program Health) and the cycle attacker-profile list/link/unlink endpoints
- [Scan Coverage (Tenable)](architecture/scan-coverage.md) - License-aware rolling coverage, Nessus Pro + Tenable.sc, .nessus→CTIS converter
- [Sensors](architecture/sensors.md) - Sensor vocabulary (scanner/agent/collector roles), code layout, protocol v2 (RFC-026 results, [RFC-029](rfcs/RFC-029-sensor-protocol-v2-and-sdk-stability.md) whole surface) and the deprecated protocol v1 legacy package (RFC-023)
- [Sensor ↔ Platform Trust](architecture/sensor-platform-trust.md) - Mutual-distrust gap analysis: every control (gateway split, per-sensor identity, object authorization, hostile results, signed jobs, local policy, credentials by reference, host hardening, audit, detections) with status, file:line evidence and the attack each gap allows today ([RFC-040](rfcs/RFC-040-platform-sensor-mutual-distrust.md))
- [Scan Zones](architecture/scan-zones.md) - Tenant address ranges → zone sensors: narrowest-zone routing and batching at trigger time, the zone claim predicate, run completion over batches, coverage view, UI contract (RFC-023 Phase 1)
- [Sensor Result Binding](architecture/sensor-result-binding.md) - Which sensor reports may change existing assets and findings: bound to an assigned command (v2 path, v1 `X-OpenCTEM-Command-ID`), unsolicited limits, collector/CI roles, tenant mode warn/quarantine, the results quarantine and its review API (RFC-040 group C, Q6 (a))
- [Audit Hash Chain](architecture/audit-hash-chain.md) - Tamper-evident per-tenant SHA-256 chain over audit_logs: append, verify, the hourly verifier, and rebaselining (when it is allowed, what is archived in the same transaction, how to review overwritten hashes)
- [Shift-Left CI Scanning](architecture/shift-left-ci-scanning.md) - Agent-first SAST/SCA/secrets in CI: structure + dataflow diagrams, branch-aware findings, risk-aware gate, PR decoration (RFC-008)
- [Ticketing Integration (Jira)](architecture/ticketing-integration.md) - Per-tenant client resolver, create/link/webhook, Mobilization
- [Tenable — User & Data Flow](architecture/tenable-user-and-data-flow.md) - How operators interact with Tenable on the UI + end-to-end data flow (agent/direct/upload)
- [Data Sources](architecture/data-sources.md) - Multi-source asset tracking, collectors, scanners
- [Global Catalog Trust](architecture/global-catalog-trust.md) - Who may write the CVE, component and license catalogs every tenant shares: trusted feeds only, tenant input creates but never changes, tenant views read the tenant's own observation first
- [Asset Schema](architecture/asset-schema.md) - Standard JSON schema for asset ingestion
- [Asset Properties Schema](asset-properties-schema.md) - JSONB properties schema per asset type
- [Database Notes](architecture/database-notes.md) - Important DB implementation details (finding_count, provider detection)
- [SSO Authentication](architecture/sso-authentication.md) - Per-tenant + env-fallback Entra/OIDC design, id_token verification, nOAuth/`xms_edov`, PKCE, verified-domain JIT gate (see also the operator [how-to](how-to/configure-entraid.md))
- [Multi-Tenant EntraID Model](architecture/multi-tenant-entraid-model.md) - "One platform, many tenants — each brings its own EntraID": per-tenant Azure apps, `?org=` login routing, and the `tid`-pin isolation wall (conceptual model)

### Authorization & Access Control
- [Authorization Matrix](architecture/authorization-matrix.md) - **Canonical "how we do authz"**: the layered model (permission / team-role / module-gate / data-scope / RLS), routes-by-auth-type, the settled rules we lock going forward (allow-only, no deny-gate, no expiring grants), the two CI invariants that stop drift, and how-to recipes (add a permission, gate a route, object-level authz)
- [Asset Deletion](architecture/asset-deletion.md) - A delete never destroys findings: refused with 409 while the asset has findings (archive instead), otherwise a soft delete that detaches the asset, frees its name and is purged after 30 days; findings FK is NO ACTION
- [Asset Ownership](architecture/asset-ownership.md) - The one owner model (`asset_owners` RACI): primary user owner and responsible owner definitions, the `owner_ref` email match, the 2026-10 migration from `assets.owner_id`, and why an owner is not an access grant (explicit `asset_access_grants`)
- [Access Control Rules](architecture/access-control-rules.md) - Scope rules + assignment rules (who sees which data, how roles are assigned)
- [User Two-Factor Authentication](architecture/user-two-factor-authentication.md) - TOTP 2FA for organization users (RFC-024): login challenge → `/auth/mfa/verify`, forced enrollment under "Require MFA", token-mint policy gate, recovery codes, immediate session revocation, My account API
- [Permission Real-time Sync](architecture/permission-realtime-sync.md) - Effective-permission cache, per-user version bump, 0-second revocation, 409-on-stale-write
- [Tenant API Keys (`oct_`)](architecture/api-keys.md) - What a key carries, read-only REST access next to MCP, scopes narrowed to what the key's user holds now, refused routes, CSRF, rate limit, audit attribution, and the open write-access decision
- [Authorization Audit (2026-09)](authz-audit.md) - End-to-end review that produced the standardization: AUTHZ-01..17 findings, endpoint inventory, and the deferred/behavior-changing items awaiting signoff
