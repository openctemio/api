# Authorization Matrix

This document describes the complete authorization model for the OpenCTEM API.

## Overview

The system uses a **two-layer authorization model**:

1. **Permission-based Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions (`resource:action`) embedded in JWT tokens
2. **Role-based Authorization**: Team roles (owner, admin, member, viewer) for team management

## Authorization Models

### Permission-based (JWT Claims)

Permissions are included in the access token and checked using `middleware.Require()`.

**The canonical permission list is code, not this document.** The single source
of truth is `permission.AllPermissions()` in
`pkg/domain/permission/permission.go`; `permission.IsValid()` /
`ParsePermission()` validate against it. As of this writing it defines
**169 permissions**, grouped by module. Rather than hand-mirror all 169 (which
would drift), the table below lists the module groups and the count each
contributes — derive the exact strings from `AllPermissions()`.

| Module group | Count | Example permissions |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| Core (dashboard, audit, settings) | 4 | `dashboard:read`, `audit:read`, `settings:read/write` |
| Assets | 11 | `assets:read/write/delete/import/export`, `asset_groups:*`, `components:*` |
| Findings | 32 | `findings:read/write/delete/assign/triage/status/export/approve/fix_apply/verify`, `exposures:*`, `suppressions:*`, `vulnerabilities:*`, `credentials:*`, `remediation:*`, `workflows:*`, `policies:*` |
| Scans | 22 | `scans:read/write/delete/execute`, `scan_profiles:*`, `sources:*`, `tools:*`, `tenant_tools:*`, `scanner_templates:*`, `secret_store:*` |
| Sensors | 9 | `sensors:read/write/delete`, `sensors:commands:read/write/delete`, `sensors:zones:read/write/delete` |
| Team | 23 | `team:*`, `members:*`, `groups:*`, `roles:*`, `permission_sets:*`, `assignment_rules:*` |
| Integrations | 18 | `integrations:read/manage`, `scm_connections:*`, `notifications:*`, `webhooks:*`, `api_keys:*`, `pipelines:*` |
| Settings (billing, SLA) | 6 | `billing:read/write/manage`, `sla:read/write/delete` |
| Attack Surface | 4 | `scope:read/write/delete`, `scope:exclusions:approve` |
| Validation (legacy) | 4 | `validation:read/write`, `pentest:read/write` |
| Pentest (granular) | 11 | `pentest_campaigns:*`, `pentest_findings:*`, `pentest_retests:*`, `pentest_templates:*`, `pentest_reports:write` |
| Compliance | 7 | `compliance_frameworks:*`, `compliance_assessments:*`, `compliance_mappings:*`, `compliance_reports:read` |
| Reports | 2 | `reports:read/write` |
| Threat Intel | 2 | `threat_intel:read/write` |
| AI Triage | 2 | `ai_triage:read/trigger` |
| CTEM (RFC-004/005) | 12 | `ctem_cycles:*`, `attacker_profiles:*`, `business_services:*`, `compensating_controls:*`, `priority_rules:*`, `verification_checklists:*` |
| **Total** | **169** | |

> There is **no `projects` module**. OpenCTEM has no `projects:*` permissions and
> no `/api/v1/projects/*` routes; the resource hierarchy is
> tenant → assets/components/findings. (This doc previously listed a phantom
> projects module — removed.)

### Role-based (Team Context)

Team roles are used for team management operations:

| Role | Level | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `owner` | 4 | Team owner - full control, can delete team |
| `admin` | 3 | Team admin - manage members, invitations, settings |
| `member` | 2 | Team member - create/edit resources |
| `viewer` | 1 | Team viewer - read-only access |

## Middleware Stack

The authorization is implemented through a middleware chain:

```
Request
   │
   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ UnifiedAuth                              │ ← Validates JWT (local or OIDC)
│ - Extracts user ID, email, tenant ID     │
│ - Extracts permissions array             │
│ - Extracts role from claims              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
   │

## API Routes by Authorization Type

### Public Routes (No Auth)

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Health check |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness check |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | User registration (403 unless `AUTH_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` or a matching invitation token) |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | User login |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/token` | Token exchange |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | Token refresh |

### JWT-Tenant Routes (Tenant from Token)

These routes use the tenant ID embedded in the JWT access token.

They also accept a tenant `oct_` API key (`Authorization: Bearer oct_…` or
`X-API-Key`), **read-only** (GET/HEAD): the tenant comes from the key, the
permissions are the key's scopes narrowed to what its user holds now, the key
is never admin, and credential/account areas (`/api-keys`, `/scim-tokens`,
`/me`, `/notifications`, `/ws`, `/platform`, `/users`, …) refuse keys. Every
ungated route must refuse keys (`tests/unit/apikey_route_policy_test.go`).
Details: [api-keys.md](./api-keys.md).

#### Assets (`/api/v1/assets`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/assets` | `assets:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/assets/{id}` | `assets:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/assets` | `assets:write` |
| `PUT /api/v1/assets/{id}` | `assets:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/assets/{id}` | `assets:delete` |

#### Business units (`/api/v1/business-units`)

| Endpoint | Gate |
|----------|------|
| `GET /api/v1/business-units` · `/{id}` | `assets:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/business-units` · `PUT /{id}` · `POST/DELETE /{id}/assets[/{assetId}]` | `assets:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/business-units/{id}` | **owner/admin only** (`RequireAdmin`, plus `assets:write`) |

> Deleting a business unit drops its asset links and detaches its child units
> for the whole organization, so it is owner/admin only (owner decision
> 2026-10-02); members keep creating, editing and linking assets.

#### Components (`/api/v1/components`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/components` | `components:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/components/{id}` | `components:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/components` | `components:write` |
| `PUT /api/v1/components/{id}` | `components:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/components/{id}` | `components:delete` |

#### Findings (`/api/v1/findings`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/findings` | `findings:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/findings/{id}` | `findings:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/findings` | `findings:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/findings/{id}` | `findings:delete` |
| `PATCH /api/v1/findings/{id}/status` | `findings:status` |
| `POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/triage` | `findings:triage` |
| `POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/assign` · `/unassign` · `/actions/assign-to-owners` | `findings:assign` |
| `POST /api/v1/findings/bulk/status` · `/bulk/assign` | `findings:bulk_update` |
| `POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/verify` | `findings:verify` |

> The finding **action** routes (status, triage, assign, bulk, verify) are gated on
> **precise granular permissions**, not the coarse `findings:write` (AUTHZ-05).
> `verify` is a separate permission from `status`/`triage` to keep
> **separation of duties** — the person who triages a finding should not be able to
> self-verify their own fix (AUTHZ B1, api#505). Migration `000217` backfilled the
> four granular perms onto every role that already held `findings:write`, so the
> tightening is honest-not-breaking: nobody lost an action they could perform before.

#### Exposures (`/api/v1/exposures`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/exposures` · `/{id}` · `/stats` · `/{id}/history` | `findings:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/exposures` · `/ingest` · `/{id}/resolve` · `/{id}/reactivate` · `PUT /{id}/ctem-id` | `findings:write` |
| `POST /api/v1/exposures/{id}/accept` · `/{id}/false-positive` | `findings:approve` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/exposures/{id}` | `findings:delete` |

> Accepted and false-positive are the dispositions a finding reaches only
> through the approval workflow (`FindingStatus.RequiresApproval`: request with
> `findings:write`, approve with `findings:approve`, never your own request).
> Exposures have no request/approve records, so these two transitions are
> gated on the approver permission itself: a `findings:write` holder (member)
> gets 403 and must ask an approver. The reason is kept in the exposure's state
> history. Unlike findings, an approver sets the state directly (no second
> person); a full request/approve flow for exposures would need its own
> records.

#### Scope exclusions (`/api/v1/scope/exclusions`)

An exclusion stops scans from touching whatever it matches, so it is a
two-person control:

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/scope/exclusions` · `/{id}` | `attack_surface:scope:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/scope/exclusions` · `PUT /{id}` · `POST /{id}/activate` · `/{id}/deactivate` | `attack_surface:scope:write` |
| `POST /api/v1/scope/exclusions/{id}/approve` · `/{id}/reject` | `attack_surface:scope:exclusions:approve` (owner, admin) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/scope/exclusions/{id}` · `POST /bulk/delete` | `attack_surface:scope:delete` |

- A new exclusion is created `pending` and is applied nowhere — not to scan
  target selection, not to `POST /scope/check`, not to coverage — until it is
  approved. Only an approved, `active`, unexpired exclusion is in effect
  (`in_effect: true` in the response); every consumer reads exclusions through
  `ExclusionRepository.ListActive`, which filters on exactly that.
- `scope:write` (held by members) only requests an exclusion.
  `attack_surface:scope:exclusions:approve` is granted to the owner and admin
  system roles (migration 000267); custom roles get it only when a tenant adds
  it.
- The requester (`created_by`) cannot approve their own exclusion, even when
  they hold the approve permission: 403, the same separation of duties as
  finding approvals.
- `reject` moves a pending exclusion to `rejected`; it can then be deleted but
  never approved or activated (409).
- `activate` only works on an approved exclusion (409 otherwise), so it cannot
  be used to skip the approval.
- Extending the window of an approved exclusion (a later `expires_at`, or
  removing it) sends it back to `pending`; shortening it keeps the approval.
- Every change to a scope target or exclusion (create, update, delete, bulk
  delete, activate, deactivate, approve, reject) is one audit entry
  (`scope_target.*`, `scope_exclusion.*`) with the caller and the state before
  and after (RFC-040 §5.11). Changes that widen what is scanned (a new or
  re-activated target, a deleted or deactivated exclusion) are `high`
  severity. Tools and tenant tool configs (`tool.*`, secret-looking config
  values masked) and scanner templates (`scanner_template.*`, content hash
  only, never the content) are audited the same way. Refused changes write
  nothing.
- Exclusions that were `active` before migration 000267 were marked approved
  (`approved_by = 'system:pre-approval-grandfathered'` where none was recorded)
  so they stay in effect; inactive and expired ones need an approval to come
  back.

Where an exclusion in effect applies (RFC-042 F16). A failed exclusion
lookup stops the path; nothing is scanned or discovered without it (fail
closed):

| Path | Effect of a match |
|------|-------------------|
| Scan trigger (direct targets and asset-group members) | Target dropped from the run; a run whose every target is excluded is refused (`ALL_TARGETS_EXCLUDED`) |
| `POST /api/v1/pipelines/runs`, the `trigger_pipeline` workflow action | Target dropped from `context.targets`, the rest run; every target excluded is refused. The same run is refused (400 `TARGET_REFUSED`) for a target the scan target validator or zone routing refuses (private address outside every zone, loopback, link-local/metadata, uncovered). `scan_zone_id` in the caller's context is ignored and set from the routing |
| Tenable rolling coverage dispatcher | Asset skipped this rotation (its cursor still moves, so it does not hold the top of every batch); same for a target the validator or zone routing refuses. A batch stays in one zone and the command is stamped with it |
| Certificate Transparency discovery | An excluded watched domain is not queried; an excluded host gets no exposure |
| Ingest | A NEW asset matching by name, repository URL or address (and a root domain or resolved IP derived from one) is not added: counted as `assets_skipped_excluded`, named in the warnings, its findings skipped and never attached to another asset. An asset already in the inventory is not changed or deleted |

All of them go through the same matcher (`scope.Service.ExcludedTargets` /
`LoadExclusionMatcher`); the pipeline and coverage paths go through
`scan.Service.ResolveDispatchTargets`, which applies a scan's checks (scan
create's target validator, exclusions, zone routing) in one call.

#### Scan zones (`/api/v1/scan-zones`, RFC-023)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/scan-zones` · `/{id}` · `/coverage` | `sensors:zones:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/scan-zones` | `sensors:zones:write` |
| `PATCH /api/v1/scan-zones/{id}` | `sensors:zones:write` |
| `PUT` · `DELETE /api/v1/scan-zones/{id}/sensors/{sensorId}` | `sensors:zones:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/scan-zones/{id}` | `sensors:zones:delete` |

> Seeded by migration `000231`: owner and admin hold all three, member and
> viewer hold `sensors:zones:read` (RFC-023 D16). Object level: every query
> carries `tenant_id`, and `scan_zone_sensors` has composite foreign keys
> `(tenant_id, zone_id)` and `(tenant_id, sensor_id)`, so a zone or sensor of
> another tenant cannot be linked even by a wrong handler. See
> [scan-zones.md](scan-zones.md).

#### Sensors (`/api/v1/sensors`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/sensors` · `/stats` · `/{id}` · `/{id}/config-templates` · `/available-capabilities` · `/content-policy` | `sensors:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/sensors` · `PUT /{id}` · `POST /{id}/regenerate-key` · `/activate` · `/deactivate` · `/revoke` | `sensors:write` |
| `PUT /api/v1/sensors/content-policy` · `POST /content/refresh` · `POST /{id}/content/refresh` (scanner content, RFC-031) | `sensors:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/sensors/{id}` | `sensors:delete` |

> **Sensors and their keys are owner/admin only** (owner decision
> 2026-10-02). Every write above creates, rotates or invalidates a sensor
> credential (`rda_…`), so `sensors:write` and `sensors:delete` are held by
> owner and admin only; migration `000246` removed `sensors:write` from the
> member role (viewer never had it). Members and viewers keep `sensors:read`.
> Scan-zone sensor assignment (`sensors:zones:write`) hands out no key and was
> already owner/admin only (`000231`). A custom role carries `sensors:write`
> only if an owner or administrator gave it one.

#### Audit log (`/api/v1/audit-logs`)

| Endpoint | Gate |
|----------|------|
| `GET /api/v1/audit-logs` · `/stats` · `/{id}` · `/resource/{type}/{id}` | `audit:read` (owner/admin only) |
| `GET /api/v1/audit-logs/user/{id}` | `audit:read`, **or `{id}` is the caller** (`RequirePermissionOrSelf`; user sessions only, not API keys) — everyone reads their own activity on `/account/activity` |
| `GET /api/v1/audit-logs/verify` | owner/admin (`RequireAdmin`) |
| `POST /api/v1/audit-logs/rebaseline` | **owner only** (`RequireOwner`) |

> The organization audit log (actor emails, IPs, every action) is owner/admin
> only: migration `000246` removed `audit:read` from member and viewer.
> Rebaseline overwrites the tamper-evident chain, so it is owner-only: an
> administrator must not be able to re-sign the chain over their own changes.

#### API keys (`/api/v1/api-keys`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/api-keys` · `/{id}` | `integrations:api_keys:read` — owner/admin see every key of the organization; anyone else sees **only their own keys** (another user's key reads as 404) |
| `POST /api/v1/api-keys` · `/{id}/revoke` | `integrations:api_keys:write` (owner/admin) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/{id}` | `integrations:api_keys:delete` (owner/admin) |

> Keys belong to the user who minted them (`api_keys.user_id`). The list shows
> key names, scopes and last-used IPs, so a member or viewer is filtered to
> their own keys in the handler (`ownKeysOnly`).

#### SCIM tokens (`/api/v1/scim-tokens`)

| Endpoint | Gate |
|----------|------|
| `GET /api/v1/scim-tokens` · `GET/PUT /group-mappings` | owner/admin (`RequireAdmin`) |
| `POST /api/v1/scim-tokens` · `DELETE /{id}` | **owner only** (`RequireOwner`) |

> A SCIM token can create, suspend and re-role every member, so minting and
> revoking one is the owner's decision (owner decision 2026-10-02).

#### Billing

`settings:billing:read` is owner/admin only (migration `000246` removed it from
member and viewer). There is no billing API route today; the permission gates
the billing page in the UI.

#### Leaked credentials (`/api/v1/credentials`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/credentials` · `/{id}` · `/{id}/related` · `/identities` · `/identities/{identity}/exposures` · `/stats` | `findings:credentials:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/credentials/import` · `/import/csv` · `/{id}/resolve` · `/reactivate` | `findings:credentials:write` |
| `POST /api/v1/credentials/{id}/accept` · `/{id}/false-positive` | `findings:credentials:write` **and** `findings:approve` (same dispositions as the exposure routes) |
| `POST /api/v1/credentials/{id}/reveal` | `findings:credentials:reveal` |

> **The leaked secret is reveal-only.** Read endpoints (here and under
> `/api/v1/exposures`) return `secret_masked` and `secret_fingerprint` (a
> keyed HMAC), never the plaintext. `findings:credentials:reveal` is held by
> owner and admin only (migration `000232`); viewer and member read the
> masked value. Every reveal writes `credential.revealed` to the audit log
> before the secret is returned, and the call answers 503 if the audit event
> cannot be written. At rest the secret is AES-256-GCM encrypted with
> `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`details.secret_value_enc`); the server seals legacy
> plaintext rows on start, and `cmd/encrypt-credentials` does the same offline.

#### Template sources and the secret store (`/api/v1/template-sources`, `/api/v1/secret-store`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/template-sources` · `/{id}` | `scans:sources:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/template-sources` · `PUT /{id}` · `/{id}/enable` · `/disable` · `/sync` | `scans:sources:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/template-sources/{id}` | `scans:sources:delete` |
| Secret store `GET` / `POST`,`PUT` / `DELETE` | `scans:secret_store:read` / `:write` / `:delete` |

> **A stored credential goes only where someone entitled to it pointed it.**
> A sync decrypts the source's `credential_id` and sends it to the source's
> URL (bearer/basic/API key, git token or SSH key, S3 keys). Members used to
> hold `scans:sources:write` (removed by migration `000262`, see rule 10) and
> still hold `scans:secret_store:write`; a custom role may carry both. The
> route gates alone would then let its holder send any stored secret to a
> server they run. `template.SourceService` therefore checks, on create and
> update:
> - **Binding** a credential (a new `credential_id`, or keeping one while the
>   destination changes) is allowed to tenant owners/admins and to the user who
>   stored that credential (`credentials.created_by`). Anyone else gets 403
>   `CREDENTIAL_BIND_FORBIDDEN`, and the attempt is audited as
>   `template_source.credential_attached` with result `denied`.
> - **Re-pointing** a source that carries a credential (git URL, HTTP URL, or
>   S3 endpoint/region/bucket/role ARN) without re-binding it in the same request
>   **drops the credential**, audited as `template_source.credential_detached`
>   (`reason: destination changed`). An S3 source cannot exist without its
>   keys, so re-pointing one needs the owner/admin to re-bind.
> - Every successful bind is audited as `template_source.credential_attached`
>   (severity high) with the credential id/name and the destination host.
>
> The secret store has no per-credential host allowlist; the binding check
> above is the control. Sources bound before this check existed keep their
> credential until they are next re-pointed.
>
> Templates synced or uploaded are validated before use. For Nuclei, the
> `code`, `javascript` and `headless` protocols are refused on the **parsed**
> document (`execProtocolKey`), so JSON, flow-style YAML, escaped or
> differently-cased keys cannot hide them.

#### Scans and commands: secret-looking config values

| Endpoint | Permission Required | `scanner_config` secrets |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/scans` · `/{id}` · `/{id}/export` | `scans:read` | masked (`********`) unless the caller has `scans:write` |
| `GET /api/v1/commands` · `/{id}` | `commands:read` | `payload` masked the same way unless the caller has `scans:write` |
| `PUT /api/v1/scans/{id}` | `scans:write` | a `********` where the stored value would be masked keeps the stored value |

> Masked values are exactly those listed in `scanner_config_warnings`
> (`pkg/domain/scan/config_secrets.go`, `config_redact.go`). Owners and
> admins pass `scans:write` through the usual bypass. Sensor command claims
> are not user responses and carry the real values.

#### Vulnerabilities (`/api/v1/vulnerabilities`) - Global

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities` | `vulnerabilities:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities/{id}` | `vulnerabilities:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities/cve/{cve_id}` | `vulnerabilities:read` |
| `POST /api/v1/vulnerabilities` | `vulnerabilities:write` |
| `PUT /api/v1/vulnerabilities/{id}` | `vulnerabilities:write` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/vulnerabilities/{id}` | `vulnerabilities:delete` |

#### Dashboard (`/api/v1/dashboard`)

| Endpoint | Permission Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats` | `dashboard:read` |
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats/global` | `dashboard:read` |

### URL-Tenant Routes (Tenant from URL)

These routes require the tenant ID in the URL path and use database-based membership verification.

#### Teams (`/api/v1/tenants`)

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/tenants` | Any authenticated |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants` | Any authenticated |
| `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}` | Any authenticated |

> These responses carry the tenant's `settings` map, which every member can
> read. Secrets stored in settings (`api.webhook_secret`, `ai.api_key`, and any
> key whose name marks it as a secret) are **write-only**:
> `tenant.RedactSettings` removes them and adds `<key>_configured: true|false`.
> The webhook signing secret is set with the owner-only
> `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/settings/api`.

#### Team Management (`/api/v1/tenants/{tenant}`)

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members` | Team viewer+; **emails, last sign-in and second-factor status only for owner/admin** (others get ids, names, avatars, roles; `search` matches names only) |
| `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/invitations` | Team viewer+ |
| `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}` | Team admin+ |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members` | Team admin+ |
| `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members/{id}` | Team admin+; **owner only when the target is an administrator** |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members/{id}/suspend` · `/reactivate` | Team admin+; **owner only when the target is an administrator** |
| `DELETE /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members/{id}` | Team admin+; **owner only when the target is an administrator** |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/invitations` | Team admin+ |
| `DELETE /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/invitations/{id}` | Team admin+ |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/users` | Team admin+ (creates an account + one-time set-password link; RFC-025) |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/users/{userId}/setup-link` | Team admin+ (only an unused account that belongs to this organization only). The link takes the account over before its first sign-in, so an **owner or admin target needs an owner**, and the caller must be able to grant every role the target holds (403 otherwise). The platform console never uses this route: it issues a new organization's owner link under the first-owner rule (emailed only, see Organizations). |
| `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/settings/security` | **Team owner only** (refuses an IP allowlist that excludes the caller's IP) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}` | **Team owner only** |

#### Invitations (`/api/v1/invitations`)

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/invitations/{token}` | Any authenticated |
| `POST /api/v1/invitations/{token}/accept` | Any authenticated (email must match) |

### User Routes (`/api/v1/users`)

| Endpoint | Required Auth |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/users/me` | JWT |
| `PUT /api/v1/users/me` | JWT |
| `PUT /api/v1/users/me/preferences` | JWT |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/tenants` | JWT |
| `POST /api/v1/users/me/change-password` | JWT (local auth only) |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/sessions` | JWT (local auth only) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/sessions` | JWT (local auth only) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/sessions/{id}` | JWT (local auth only) |

### Build version

| Endpoint | Required Auth |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/version` | JWT (any signed-in user; no `oct_` keys) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/version` | Console session (any admin role) |

The running build (`version`, `commit`, `build_time`, `channel`) for Help >
About. Deliberately not on the public `/health`: an unauthenticated client
cannot fingerprint the build. Release images stamp it with `-ldflags` from the
tag; the dev container's air build stamps `<highest tag>-dev`; an unstamped
binary reads the checkout's `.git` (`pkg/version`).

### Real-time WebSocket (`/api/v1/auth/ws-token`, `/api/v1/ws`)

A WebSocket ticket opens the tenant's real-time stream, so it is held to the
same tenant gates as any JWT-tenant route.

| Endpoint | Required Auth |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/auth/ws-token` | JWT session (no `oct_` keys) + tenant chain: SSO enforcement, organization IP allowlist, `RequireTenant`, active membership (`wsTokenMiddlewares`) |
| `GET /api/v1/ws/?ticket=…` | Single-use ticket (Redis `GETDEL`, 30 s), bound to the user + tenant it was issued for; **active membership re-checked at upgrade** (`WSTicketAuth`) |

- A suspended member, a user who is not a member of the token's tenant, a
  caller outside the organization's IP allowlist (403 `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`) and a
  password session in an SSO-enforced tenant get no ticket.
- A member suspended or removed between issue and upgrade gets 403 on the
  upgrade. The upgrade does not re-run the IP allowlist (the ticket is
  single-use and lives 30 s).
- Without Redis (no ticket service) `/ws` falls back to a short-lived JWT and
  the full `buildTokenTenantMiddlewares` chain.
- After the upgrade, every channel subscription is authorized by
  `websocket.Hub.defaultAuthorize` against the connection's user and tenant
  (own `user:{tenant}:{user}` only, own `tenant:{id}` only, permission +
  data scope for `finding:`/`triage:`, `scans:read` for `scan:`).

### Platform Admin Routes (`/api/v1/admin/*`)

Platform admin routes are for OpenCTEM operators, NOT tenant users. They
authenticate **only** with a **console session** (RFC-022: `/login` password
sign-in + mandatory TOTP, server-side session in the `admin_session` cookie,
scoped to `/api/v1/admin`; cookie-authenticated writes must pass the
`admin_csrf` double-submit check). There are **no admin API keys**: an
`X-Admin-API-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` header authenticates nothing here,
so every admin action has passed TOTP. The session resolves to an
`admin_users` row with a platform role: `super_admin` > `ops_admin` >
`readonly`. The tenant JWT never authenticates these routes, and the admin
session never reaches tenant routes.

Authorization is enforced at the **route layer** in
`internal/infra/http/routes/admin.go` via `AdminAuthMiddleware.RequireRole(...)`
— not in the handlers.

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/admin/auth/validate` | any admin |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/session`, `/mfa` | public (rate-limited; needs the `/login` refresh cookie, then TOTP) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/logout` | public (ends the caller's own console and `/login` session) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/password` | any admin (the only write allowed while `password_change_required`) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/auth/idp` | public (enabled + display name of the platform IdP, nothing else) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/idp/start`, `/idp/callback` | public (token-exchange rate limit, 20/min; state bound to the `admin_idp` cookie, single use) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/administrators` | **super_admin** (audited; `break_glass` audited high) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/reset-credentials` | **super_admin** (audited; not self) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/break-glass-test` | **super_admin** (audited; not the break-glass account itself) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/idp-binding` | **super_admin** (audited high) |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/admin/platform-idp` | **super_admin** (writes audited high; secret never returned) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/users` | **super_admin** |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/users/{id}` | **super_admin** |
| `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{id}` | **super_admin** (audited) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/{id}` | **super_admin** (audited) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs` (+ `/stats`, `/{id}`) | any admin (readonly ok) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/target-mappings` (+ `/stats`, `/types`, `/{id}`) | any admin |
| `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/admin/target-mappings` | **ops_admin+** (rate-limited, audited) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/audit-chain` | any admin (classifies the organization's audit hash-chain; read-only) |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/audit-chain/rebaseline` | **super_admin** + a fresh console TOTP code in the body (step-up; a wrong code counts toward lockout). Refused 409 when a break is unexplained or the chain changed since the reviewed classification. Audited high in `admin_audit_logs` and as `audit.chain_rebaselined` in the organization's log |

> The admin roster (`/admin/users`) is super_admin-only for reads as well as
> writes: it exposes admin emails and last-used IPs, so listing
> it is itself a privileged operation.

### SSO / identity-federation setup (platform administrator)

SSO **setup** for an organization (SAML, OIDC identity providers, verified
domains, SSO enforcement) is a platform-administrator operation, modeled on
Tenable Security Center's system-level Configuration. It lives only under the
admin realm, `/api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/sso/*` (next section). The former
tenant-context routes `/api/v1/settings/{saml,identity-providers,verified-domains}`
and the `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS` flag that guarded them were removed; no tenant
role, however high, can reach SSO setup. The SSO **login** flow
(`/api/v1/auth/sso/*`, `/api/v1/auth/saml/{org}/*`) is public and unchanged.

### Platform administrator identity (RFC-022)

A platform administrator is a `users` account linked to an `admin_users` row
(`admin_users.user_id`) that holds the role (`super_admin` > `ops_admin` >
`readonly`), the TOTP second factor and the admin audit trail. It signs in on the
normal `/login`, then `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/session` (refresh-token cookie)
and `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/mfa` open a console session. Rules:

- **Belongs to no organization.** A trigger on `tenant_members` rejects a
  membership for a linked account (SQLSTATE 23514, surfaced as 409), and an
  account with memberships cannot be linked. This is what keeps a tenant
  role and the platform role from ever meeting in one principal.
- **Password sign-in only.** A session created by SSO, SAML or a social provider
  cannot open the console, so no organization's IdP can authenticate an
  administrator.
- **TOTP always.** The `/login` session alone reaches nothing under
  `/api/v1/admin/*`; only a verified console session does (there are no
  admin API keys).
- Provisioning is `POST /api/v1/admin/administrators` (super admin), or
  `bootstrap-admin` for the first one and its break-glass backup. Rows without
  a `user_id` (former API-key identities) were deactivated by migration 000227.
- **Temporary password gate.** A provisioned account has
  `password_change_required`; a password-authenticated console session can then
  call only `GET /auth/validate` and `POST /auth/password` (403
  `PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED` otherwise).

#### Break-glass administrators and the platform IdP (RFC-022 revision 4)

- **Platform IdP** (`platform_identity_provider`, one OIDC provider, not
  tenant-scoped) is the only IdP that can open the console, and only for an
  administrator that already exists: matched by bound (`iss`, `sub`), or on
  first sign-in by verified email, then bound. No JIT creation. The console TOTP
  is still required after it unless a super admin trusts specific `acr`/`amr`
  values. Organization IdPs still cannot open the console.
- **Require IdP** refuses the local password path (`/auth/session`) for every
  administrator except break-glass ones.
- **Break-glass** administrators are local `super_admin`s that can never be
  bound to the IdP (database `CHECK`), are exempt from "require IdP", and every
  sign-in is audited high + alerted (`alert=break_glass_sign_in` + email).
- **Invariant** (server-side, under an advisory lock): at least one active,
  linked `super_admin` who can sign in locally always remains — while "require
  IdP" is in force, at least one break-glass `super_admin`. Delete, deactivate,
  demote and unmark that would break it return 409, as does turning on "require
  IdP" without one.

### Organizations — platform admin cross-tenant (RFC-022 Phase 2)

Under the admin realm (console session), never tenant-permission
gated. Organization-scoped SSO routes reuse the tenant SSO handlers through
`AdminTenantScope`, which checks the organization exists, sets it as the request
tenant, and **clears the user id** (the principal is the admin identity, not an
organization member, and those handlers write `created_by` columns that
reference `users(id)`). Writes are
recorded in `admin_audit_logs`, and in the organization's own audit log with
`actor_email = platform-admin:<email>`, `actor_id` NULL and `actor_ip` the
resolved client IP (forwarding headers only from a trusted proxy). The
organization's log gets: `sso.saml_config_updated` / `_deleted`,
`sso.identity_provider_created` / `_updated` / `_deleted`,
`sso.verified_domain_added` / `_verified` / `_deleted` (severity high; written
by the SAML, SSO and verified-domain handlers), `tenant.settings_updated` for
SSO enforcement, and `user.created` for console-created users. Client secrets
and certificates are never logged — an IdP update records
`client_secret_changed`, a SAML save records the certificate's SHA-256.

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants` (+ `/{tenantId}`) | any admin |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants` | **ops_admin+** (audited; creates the owner's account when `owner_email` has none) |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/users` | any admin |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/users` | **ops_admin+**, **bootstrap only**: creates the first owner of an organization with no owner, active or suspended, nothing else (409 otherwise). With `"recovery": true`: **super_admin** only (403 otherwise), for an organization whose owners are all suspended (409 while one is active), link emailed only (400 without email). Audited in `admin_audit_logs` (`organization.user_create` / `organization.owner_recovery`) and the organization's audit log |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/sso/{saml,identity-providers,verified-domains,enforcement}` | any admin |
| `PUT/POST/DELETE` on those SSO resources | **super_admin** (audited). SAML `PUT` and identity-provider `POST`/`PUT` on an organization **with an owner** only store a pending change (202) that an owner must approve; see below |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/sso/changes` | any admin (what is waiting for the owner) |

**First-owner bootstrap** (owner decision 2026-10-02, RFC-022 revision 5).
The platform administrator belongs to no organization and cannot put a person
of its choosing into one: `POST /admin/tenants/{tenantId}/users` creates only
the first owner of an organization that has no owner, active or suspended (checked and
inserted in one transaction under a per-organization advisory lock, so two
requests cannot create two owners), and answers 409 once an owner exists — the
owner and its administrators add users themselves. The account is created
without a password; the owner sets one through a one-time link, so the
administrator never knows it and the owner's first sign-in is with a password
they chose. The link is **emailed when the organization can send email** and is
then never returned (a failed send reports `email_failed`; the owner uses
forgot-password). Only when email cannot be sent at all is `setup_token`
returned once: there is no other way to reach the new owner, and nobody in the
organization can invite them yet. The same delivery rule applies to the owner
created with `POST /admin/tenants`. Each is written to the organization's audit
log (`user.created`, `bootstrap_owner: true`, actor `platform-admin:<email>`).

**Owner recovery** (RFC-022 revision 7). A suspended owner still owns the
organization, so the bootstrap is refused. When every owner is suspended, a
**super_admin** may send `"recovery": true` to create a new owner. Other
console roles get 403, an active owner means 409, and an organization that
cannot send email gets 400. The link is emailed only, never returned. It is
audited as `organization.owner_recovery` (admin log, high, refusals included)
and as `user.created` with `owner_recovery: true` at critical severity in the
organization's log.

**SSO changes wait for an owner** (owner decision 2026-10-02, RFC-022
revision 8). A platform administrator who could set an organization's SAML
certificate or OIDC client could sign in as any of its members, so on an
organization that has an active owner those writes are stored in
`sso_pending_changes` and the live config is untouched until an owner decides:

| Endpoint | Required Role |
|----------|---------------|
| `GET /api/v1/tenants/{t}/settings/sso/changes` | **owner** (`RequireTeamOwner`) |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{t}/settings/sso/changes/{id}/approve` | **owner** (`RequireTeamOwner` + the service re-checks active ownership in the database); applies the change and marks it approved in one transaction; audited `sso.change_approved` |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{t}/settings/sso/changes/{id}/reject` | **owner** (same gates); audited `sso.change_rejected` |

Administrators, members and viewers of the organization get 403; an owner of
another organization gets 404 (the change is looked up in the caller's
organization) or 403 (naming the other organization fails the ownership
check). An expired change (7 days) answers 410; one already decided or
superseded by a newer submission answers 409. Every active owner is notified
in-app (`sso_change_pending`) and by email when SMTP is configured, without
secrets. **Bootstrap exception:** an organization with no active owner gets the
change applied directly. Deletes, SSO enforcement and verified domains are not
gated (none adds a way in).

**Tenant-side counterparts:**
- `PATCH /tenants/{t}/settings/security` refuses `sso_enforced` with 403.
  Enforcement is set only through `PUT /admin/tenants/{tenantId}/sso/enforcement`,
  which keeps the "usable SSO path required" guard.
- With `TENANT_CREATION_MODE=admin_only` (the default; anything but
  `self_service` counts), both self-service creation paths
  (`POST /api/v1/tenants` and `POST /api/v1/auth/create-first-team`) return
  403. Only `POST /admin/tenants` (and `bootstrap-admin -org-*` at install)
  creates organizations. The mode is published
  as `tenant_creation_mode` on the public `GET /api/v1/auth/providers`.

### Metrics Endpoint (`GET /metrics`)

`/metrics` (Prometheus) is **not public by default**. It is gated by
`MetricsConfig`:

| `METRICS_PUBLIC` | `METRICS_TOKEN` | Behavior |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `false` (default) | set | Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `X-Metrics-Token`). Missing/wrong → 404 |
| `false` (default) | empty | Endpoint disabled (fail closed, 404) |
| `true` | — | Open, no auth (legacy; use only when firewalled to an internal scrape network) |

`/health` and `/ready` remain public. Configure the scraper's bearer token to
match `METRICS_TOKEN`.

## Organization access policy (RFC-025)

Two per-organization policies (`Security.AllowedDomains`, `Security.IPWhitelist`,
owner-managed) are enforced, not just stored. See
[user-onboarding.md](./user-onboarding.md).

- **Allowed email domains** gate every way into the organization: invitations
  (create and accept), invited registration, administrator-created users,
  `AddMember`/SCIM, and SSO just-in-time provisioning.
- **IP allowlist**: `middleware.IPAllowlistGate` runs on every user-token
  request (in `buildBaseMiddlewares` for the token's organization and after
  `RequireMembership` on `/tenants/{tenant}` for the URL organization), and on
  every tenant `oct_` API-key request on the REST API. Not applied to sensor
  keys, the MCP endpoint, the admin console, or public routes. 403 `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`; lookup errors fail closed; client IP from
  `httpsec.ClientIP` (trusted proxies only).
- **Self-registration** (`POST /auth/register`) is off unless
  `AUTH_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true`; a pending invitation for the same email opens
  it for that person only.

## Data scope (Layer 2: access groups)

Permissions decide what *kind* of thing a member may do; the data scope decides
*which* assets — and so which findings, exposures and other asset-bound rows —
they may see and change. Scope rows live in `user_accessible_assets` (group
membership × group-owned assets, plus assets a user owns directly).

**Who is restricted:**

| Caller | Sees |
|---|---|
| Owner / admin (`IsAdmin`) | everything in the tenant |
| Internal calls with no user (jobs, sensors, ingest) | everything in the tenant |
| Member with ≥ 1 scope row | only their in-scope assets |
| Member with no scope row | the organization's policy: **everything** or **nothing** |

**Policy for members without an access group** (owner decision 2026-10-02):
`tenants.members_without_group_see` (migration `000247`), `everything`
(fail-open) or `nothing` (fail-closed, Tenable's "No Access").

- Organizations that existed when the migration ran keep `everything`, so
  nobody lost access; one that had switched on the earlier settings flag
  (`settings.security.restricted_data_scope = true`, no longer read) keeps
  `nothing`.
- New organizations start with `nothing` (column default).
- `GET`/`PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/settings/data-scope`
  (`{"members_without_group_see": "everything"|"nothing"}`), owner/admin
  (`RequireTeamAdmin`). A change is audited (`tenant.settings_updated`,
  severity high, before/after in `changes`) and drops the enforcer's 60-second
  policy cache for that organization at once.
- A failure to read the policy is treated as `everything` (a database hiccup
  must not hide all data); every other scope-lookup error denies.

**One enforcement point.** `internal/app/datascope.Enforcer` resolves the
caller's scope (caller and admin flag come from the HTTP auth context, wired in
`cmd/server/services.go`) and is shared by every service. Nil-safe: an unwired
service is unrestricted. Out-of-scope by-id access returns **404**, never 403 —
the same answer as a missing row, so it is not an existence oracle; in bulk
results an out-of-scope id is reported exactly like an unknown id.

- **By-id routes:** `middleware.DataScopeGuard` runs last on every token-tenant
  chain (`buildTokenTenantMiddlewares`). Any request under
  `/api/v1/assets/{uuid}/**`, `/api/v1/findings/{uuid}/**`,
  `/api/v1/compliance/findings/{uuid}/**` or
  `/api/v1/verification-checklists/{uuid}` — read or write, the object or any
  sub-resource, including routes added later — is checked before the handler.
- **Bulk-by-id and id-in-body paths:** services filter with the same enforcer.
- **Grouped / by-filter finding queries** (`/findings/groups`, related CVEs,
  verify / reject-fix / fix-applied by filter, assign-to-owners):
  `FindingActionsService.visibleTo`
  applies the enforcer's scope and the findings list's pentest-membership rule;
  the group builder (`buildFilterWhere`) honors both filter fields with the
  list's meaning, and a rule without a tenant matches nothing. Remediation
  groups resolve the scope in `remediation.GroupService` and pass it to the
  key repository (`ListGroups`, `OpenFindingIDs`). Do not set
  `FindingFilter.DataScopeUserID` by hand in new code: use the enforcer
  (`Resolve` + `WithDataScope`), which knows who is an administrator and the
  organization's policy. Inside the finding package every filter-driven path
  goes through one helper (`visibleFilter`: `visibleTo`, `ListFindingIDs`).
  Three older paths still set the field themselves with the caller's admin
  flag and `DataScopeStrict` from the same policy — the findings list/search,
  the asset list and `/findings/stats`; their SQL gives the same answer as a
  resolved scope (fail-open bypass only when the policy is `everything`).
- **Indirect lists:** the resolved scope is pushed into SQL as
  `asset_id IN (SELECT asset_id FROM user_accessible_assets WHERE user_id = $u AND tenant_id = $t)`
  (index `(user_id, asset_id)`), built once in `postgres.dataScopeCond`.

| In-app notifications (`GET /notifications`, unread count, live push) for finding / asset events | **bypass (audience all, body = finding message)** | a finding/asset notice is listed, counted and pushed only to users whose scope covers its asset |
| WebSocket `finding:{id}`, `triage:{id}` | **bypass** (permission only) | also requires the finding to be in scope |

### Deliberately tenant-wide (counts only, no row data)

These return aggregates over the whole tenant to every holder of the read
permission. Filtering them would need a scoped variant of each aggregate
query; none exposes a row, name, title or id of an out-of-scope object.

| Endpoint | Why tenant-wide |
|---|---|
| `GET /dashboard/stats` counts (assets/findings by type, status, severity, avg risk/CVSS, repositories, finding trend) | one batched aggregate query; counts only |
| `GET /dashboard/{mttr,velocity,data-quality,risk-trend,mttr-analytics,process-metrics,program-metrics}`, executive-summary metrics | program-level KPIs, counts and averages |
| `GET /attack-surface/stats` average risk score and per-type breakdown | aggregate; the counts and row lists on that endpoint are scoped |
| `summary` blocks of attack paths / exposure chains | graph-wide counts (reachability needs the whole graph) |
| `GET /assets/stats`, `/assets/facets`, `/assets/tags` | aggregate counts / tag vocabulary |
| `GET /exposures/stats` | counts by state/severity, MTTR |
| `GET /findings/analytics/sources`, `/vulnerabilities/active`, `/active/stats` | counts per tool / per CVE |
| `GET /approvals` `total` | the page is filtered; the total is the tenant's pending count |

**Not covered by data scope** (separate access models): pentest findings and
attachments (campaign membership), threat models and remediation campaigns,
scans, audit logs, report schedules, and access-control administration
(`/groups/{id}/assets/{assetId}`, which defines scope and needs `groups:write`).
The reachability oracle used by priority classification and threat models reads
the full graph on purpose (`GetExposureChains` stays unscoped).

Outside a request (WebSocket subscriptions, cross-organization dashboard) admin
status is the team role from `v_user_effective_role` (owner/admin) — the same
source as the access token's `admin` claim; the live-push recipient query reads
the same view in SQL. Keep them in step if that derivation changes.

## Module-Gate Layer (per-tenant feature gating)

Above the permission and role checks there is a third, orthogonal layer: the
**module gate**. `middleware.ModuleGate.RequireModule(moduleID)`
(`internal/infra/http/middleware/module_gate.go`) wraps a route group and returns
`403 MODULE_NOT_ENABLED` when the tenant has explicitly disabled that product
module. It is wired onto **26 route groups** in
`internal/infra/http/routes/routes.go` — e.g. `attack_surface`, `exposures`,
`suppressions`, `remediation`, `compliance`, `pentest`, `threat_intel`,
`reports`, `ctem_cycles`, `attacker_profiles`, `business_services`,
`compensating_controls`, `priority_rules`, `scope_config`, `components`,
`relationships`, `credentials`, `workflows`, `integrations`, `scan_pipelines`,
`scanner_templates`, `template_sources`, `attack_simulation`, `control_testing`,
`branches`, `iocs`.

**This is a feature gate, not a security boundary, and it is deliberately
fail-open.** A nil gate, missing provider, empty tenant, a core module, or any
lookup miss all resolve to "enabled" — only an explicitly-disabled non-core
module returns 403. Disabled sets are cached per tenant with a short TTL (60s
default) and invalidated on toggle. Permission and tenant-isolation checks are
the real access-control boundary; the gate only hides modules a tenant has
turned off. Core modules (see `module.IsCoreModule`) can never be gated off.

## Middleware Reference

### Permission Middleware

```go
// Single permission required
middleware.Require(permission.AssetsRead)

// Any of the permissions (OR)
middleware.RequireAny(permission.AssetsRead, permission.FindingsRead)

// All permissions required (AND)
middleware.RequireAll(permission.AssetsWrite, permission.FindingsWrite)
```

### Role Middleware (Team Context)

```go
// Specific roles required (from database membership)
middleware.RequireTeamRole(tenant.RoleOwner, tenant.RoleAdmin)

// Minimum role level (uses hierarchy)
middleware.RequireMinTeamRole(tenant.RoleAdmin)  // admin or owner

// Shortcuts
middleware.RequireTeamAdmin()   // owner or admin
middleware.RequireTeamOwner()   // owner only
middleware.RequireTeamWrite()   // owner, admin, or member
```

### Tenant Middleware

```go
// JWT-based tenant (from token claims)
middleware.RequireTenant()

// URL-based tenant (from path parameter)
middleware.TenantContext(tenantRepo)
middleware.RequireMembership(tenantRepo)
```

## Implementation Pattern

### Permission-based Routes (Recommended)

```go
router.Group("/api/v1/assets", func(r Router) {
    // Read operations
    r.GET("/", h.List, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsRead))
    r.GET("/{id}", h.Get, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsRead))

    // Write operations
    r.POST("/", h.Create, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsWrite))
    r.PUT("/{id}", h.Update, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsWrite))

    // Delete operations
    r.DELETE("/{id}", h.Delete, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsDelete))
}, authMiddleware, userSyncMiddleware, middleware.RequireTenant())
```

### Role-based Routes (Team Management)

```go
router.Group("/api/v1/tenants/{tenant}", func(r Router) {
    // Read operations - any member
    r.GET("/members", h.ListMembers)

    // Admin operations
    r.PATCH("/", h.Update, middleware.RequireTeamAdmin())
    r.POST("/members", h.AddMember, middleware.RequireTeamAdmin())

    // Owner-only operations
    r.DELETE("/", h.Delete, middleware.RequireTeamOwner())
}, authMiddleware, userSyncMiddleware, tenantContext, requireMembership)
```

## Role Hierarchy

```
owner (4) ─┬─ Can do everything
           │
admin (3) ─┼─ Can manage team members and settings
           │
member (2) ┼─ Can create/edit resources
           │
viewer (1) ┴─ Can only view resources
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Access tokens are scoped to a specific tenant. Users must exchange their refresh token for a tenant-scoped access token.

2. **Permission Validation**: The access token carries the user's full permission
   array, so the hot path checks permissions in-token with no per-request DB read.
   To close the stale-token window, a per-user **permission version** (Redis `INCR`)
   is bumped on any grant/revoke — every `RoleService` role-set change and the
   member-role update (`PATCH /tenants/{t}/members/{id}`). On every token-tenant
   request `EnrichPermissions` resolves the effective permission set from
   Redis/DB, and:
   - `HasPermission` then answers **only from that fresh set**; the token's
     embedded array is never consulted again on that request, so a revoked
     permission stops working on the next request, **reads included**;
   - when the token's version is confirmed **stale**, a **write** is rejected
     with `409 permissions_stale`; a **read** proceeds only after the token's
     `admin` flag and `role` are **re-derived from the database** (the team role,
     read from `tenant_members`/`user_roles` without the membership cache), so a
     demoted admin loses the admin bypass on the next request. If the team role
     or the permission set cannot be read for a stale token, the read gets the
     same `409` (fail closed);
   - when the token is **not** stale and the permission lookup fails
     (Redis/DB outage), the token's own permissions are used: they are current,
     and an outage is not a revocation.

   Role-set changes also drop the user's cached membership, so
   `RequireTeamAdmin/Owner` see the new team role on the next request.
   `RevokeAllSessions` forces immediate re-auth. So the token is the fast path,
   but the database is the source of truth — see
   [permission-realtime-sync.md](./permission-realtime-sync.md).

3. **IDOR Prevention**: JWT-based tenant routes eliminate IDOR by design - users can only access their current tenant's data.

4. **Team Management Security**: Team operations use database-based membership verification via `RequireMembership` middleware.

5. **Owner Protection**: Team owners cannot be demoted or removed. Only team deletion removes the owner.

6. **Invitation Security**: Invitations are validated against the accepting user's email address.

## Settled model — the rules we lock going forward

The authorization model was reviewed end-to-end (2026-09, `docs/authz-audit.md`)
and standardized. The following are **decisions**, not accidents — each was made
deliberately and, where a design choice was involved, benchmarked against
Tenable.sc's RBAC.

1. **Allow-only, default-deny.** A user's effective permission set is the *union*
   of what their roles grant. There is **no deny-override**: a permission-set can
   only *add* capability, never subtract it at the enforcement layer. A "deny" that
   appears in the UI/permission-set model is advisory (Layer-2), it does **not**
   gate the API. This mirrors Tenable.sc, which is purely additive with no
   deny-override. → we will **not** build a permission-set deny-gate.

2. **Backend is the only authority.** The frontend hides controls the user lacks
   perms for as a UX nicety; it is never the boundary. Every mutation is
   independently gated server-side. UI perm checks that duplicate a server gate are
   convenience, not security.

3. **Effective permissions come from the database, not blindly from the token.**
   The token is the fast path; the per-user permission version + `EnrichPermissions`
   re-resolution + `409` on stale writes make the DB the source of truth (see
   Security Consideration #2 and `permission-realtime-sync.md`).

4. **Granular over coarse.** Action routes are gated on the most precise permission
   that describes the action (e.g. `findings:status`, not `findings:write`), so the
   role matrix tells the truth about who can do what. Tightening a role's grant is a
   *product* decision made via seed/migration, never by silently widening a route's
   gate.

5. **No time-limited grants.** There is no `expires_at` on role assignments.
   Tenable.sc has no expiring grants either; revocation is immediate via
   `RevokeAllSessions` + version bump. → we will **not** build expiring grants (YAGNI).

6. **The module gate is a feature flag, not a security boundary.** It is fail-open
   by design (see "Module-Gate Layer"). Never rely on it to protect data — that is
   the job of the permission gate + tenant isolation.

7. **`user_roles` is the RBAC role set; the team role comes from the system role IDs only.**
   Permissions are resolved only from `user_roles`, which holds exactly the roles
   an administrator granted (custom roles, several roles, or none).
   The **team role** (owner/admin/member/viewer) is what the token's `role` claim
   and `admin` flag, `IsOwner`/`RequireOwner`/`RequireAdmin`, and
   `RequireTeamAdmin/Owner` all read. It is computed by the view
   `v_user_effective_role` (migration `000245`), one row per membership:
   - the highest of the four **system roles** the user holds, matched by role
     id (`…0001` owner > `…0002` admin > `…0003` member > `…0004` viewer);
   - a user holding no system role gets the membership label
     (`tenant_members.role`, derived by `MembershipRoleForRoleIDs`), **capped at
     `member`**: an `owner`/`admin` label without the matching system role
     resolves to `viewer`. Removing every role from an administrator therefore
     removes their admin powers.
   - **Custom roles never count**, whatever their slug or `hierarchy_level`.
     Before `000245` the view took the slug of the highest-`hierarchy_level`
     role, so a custom role with slug `owner` and level 100 made its holder
     owner (audit F1). Custom roles may no longer use a system slug
     (`owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer`) or a level at or above admin's 80
     (service validation + `CHECK` constraints `roles_custom_slug_not_reserved`
     and `roles_custom_level_below_admin`); the migration renamed offending
     roles to `custom-<slug>` and clamped levels to 79. `hierarchy_level` is
     display order only.
   - The token's `role` claim is this team role; RBAC role slugs are never put
     in its place.

   Nothing may re-derive the role set from the label: the `role-sync` controller
   only restores the owner role of a tenant owner who lacks it, and reports (does
   not repair) active members with no role. It used to re-grant the label's
   system role hourly, which brought back roles administrators had removed.

8. **Role grants are bounded by the granter's own grants** (`accesscontrol/grant_guard.go`).
   Every path that changes a role set (assign, set, bulk assign, remove,
   invitation/created-user grants) or what a custom role carries (create,
   update) is checked in `RoleService` against the actor's roles in the
   database: only an owner may grant the owner role; anyone else may grant only
   roles whose permissions (and full data access) they hold, so nobody can raise
   their own privileges; **removal has the same ceiling** (`RemoveRole`, and every
   role `SetUserRoles` drops): nobody may take away a role they could not have
   granted, so a delegated role manager cannot strip admin from an administrator;
   only an owner may change an owner's roles, and the tenant's owner keeps the
   owner role. **Deleting a custom role has the same ceiling** (`DeleteRole`,
   owner decision 2026-10-02): `DELETE /api/v1/roles/{id}` needs
   `team:roles:delete` *and* every permission (and full data access) the role
   carries, so an administrator cannot delete an owner-built role holding
   owner-only permissions (403); owners may delete any custom role. The handler-level check
   (`assertCanGrantPermissions`) lets administrators through, so the service is
   the enforcement point. SCIM mappings, SSO/SAML JIT and the membership-role
   update can never produce `owner`.

9. **Owner/admin-only surfaces (owner decision 2026-10-02).** Sensor writes
   and keys, the audit log, billing, and other users' API keys are owner/admin
   only; peer administrators, audit-chain rebaseline and SCIM token mint/revoke
   are owner only; the platform administrator only bootstraps an
   organization's first owner. Members and viewers keep the member list and
   `sensors:read`. **Member emails are owner/admin only** (owner decision
   2026-10-02, superseding the earlier "emails stay visible"): the member list
   (`GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}/members?include=user`) omits `email` and
   `last_login_at` for anyone else and its `search` matches names only, so a
   search cannot confirm an address; ids, names and avatars stay for the
   assignee and owner pickers. Business-unit delete is owner/admin only.
   Role diff (migration `000246`):

   | Role | Removed |
   |------|---------|
   | member | `sensors:write`, `audit:read`, `settings:billing:read` |
   | viewer | `audit:read`, `settings:billing:read` |

10. **Custom templates are trusted code (owner decision 2026-10-02).** A
    custom scanner template (nuclei especially) decides which hosts the sensor
    contacts and what it sends, so only owners and administrators author one:
    `scans:templates:write` (scanner templates) and `scans:sources:write`
    (template sources, which pull templates from a URL) are owner/admin only;
    migration `000262` removed both from member. Members and viewers keep
    `scans:templates:read` / `scans:sources:read` and pick approved templates
    for a scan by id (`scanner_config.custom_template_ids`). `POST
    /api/v1/commands` refuses a payload that embeds `custom_templates`
    unless the caller is an owner or administrator (403), even though members
    hold `commands:write`. Templates are still validated as above. The
    sensor-side half (custom-template traffic through the RFC-034
    scope-enforcing forwarder) is an RFC-034 follow-up.

    | Role | Removed |
    |------|---------|
    | member | `scans:templates:write`, `scans:sources:write` |

11. **Scan commands are owner/admin only and scoped (RFC-040 Q5 (c), owner
    decision 2026-10-03).** `POST /api/v1/commands` with `type: "scan"`
    makes a sensor scan whatever the payload names, so it is refused (403)
    for anyone but owners and administrators, although members keep
    `commands:write` for the other command types. For an administrator the
    payload's `target`/`targets` go through the checks of a scan trigger
    (`scan.Service.GateCommandPayload`): the target validator with the
    private-range policy (internal addresses only inside a scan zone), active
    scope exclusions (a failed lookup refuses, fail closed), and zone routing
    (all targets in one zone, nothing uncovered, a pinned sensor assigned to
    that zone; the command is stamped with the zone). Any refused target
    refuses the whole command (400) instead of being dropped, targets nested
    in `config`, `scanner_config`, `context` or `step_config` are refused,
    and the stored payload carries the checked list. Every attempt is
    audited as `command.created`: `success` with sensor, zone and targets, or
    `denied` with the reason. Without the gate wired, scan commands answer
    500 (fail closed).

### Known, deliberate gaps (do not "fix" without a decision)

- **Two admin oracles.** Permission-based `IsAdmin` (from the token) and live-DB
  team-role (`RequireTeamAdmin/Owner`) are separate mechanisms. They read the
  same team role, and a role change makes the token stale, after which
  `EnrichPermissions` re-derives `IsAdmin`/`role` from the database (see Security
  Consideration #2), so they no longer disagree after a demotion on the
  token-tenant chains. Unifying them onto live membership on every request
  (which would also fix `IsOwner` under OIDC) is a phased refactor —
  **deferred** because a missing membership middleware on any chain would 403 a
  whole route group.
- **Data scope for members without a group is a per-organization choice.**
  Decided 2026-10-02: existing organizations stay `everything` (fail-open), new
  ones start `nothing`, administrators choose (see *Data scope* above). Do not
  change an organization's value in a migration without its owner.
- **RLS is shadow-mode.** ~99 policies exist, 0 tables have RLS enabled. This is
  intentional (staged rollout), not a dead control. Tenant isolation is enforced by
  convention (`WHERE tenant_id = $n`) today; do not assume RLS backstops it.

## CI invariants that keep this from drifting

Two tests fail the build if the model erodes. Treat them as executable spec:

| Invariant | Test | What it guarantees |
|-----------|------|--------------------|
| **Every route is gated or explicitly allowlisted** | `tests/unit/route_authz_coverage_test.go` (AUTHZ-02) | A go/ast walk of `routes/*.go` resolves chi `.Group` nesting + inherited gates; any route with no `Require*`/`RequireTeam*`/`RequireRole` and not in `allowlistPrefixes` fails the build, naming the route. Removing one `Require(...)` → red. |
| **Go permission registry ≡ DB seed** | `tests/unit/permission_catalog_sync_test.go` (AUTHZ-17) | Parses the seed migrations and asserts set-equality with `permission.AllPermissions()`. A permission added to code but not seeded (or vice-versa) → red. |

The permission strings themselves are also mirrored in the UI (TS constants); the
sync test covers Go↔DB, and code review covers UI drift until the monorepo contract
codegen (RFC-020) subsumes both.

## How to … (recipes that stay inside the invariants)

### Add a new permission

1. Add the constant to `pkg/domain/permission/permission.go` **and** include it in
   `AllPermissions()`.
2. Add the same string to the DB seed (a new numbered migration under
   `migrations/` — additive `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, with a matching
   `.down.sql`).
3. Add the string to the UI permission constants so the frontend can gate on it.
4. Map it into the default roles that should hold it (`role_mapping.go` + seed).
5. `go test ./tests/unit/...` — the catalog-sync test proves 1↔2 agree.

### Gate a new route

- Attach the least-privilege permission at registration:
  `r.POST("/", h.Create, middleware.Require(permission.FooWrite))`.
- For team-management routes under `/tenants/{tenant}`, use `RequireTeamAdmin()` /
  `RequireTeamOwner()` (live membership) instead of a permission.
- If the whole route group belongs to a product module, wrap it with
  `ModuleGate.RequireModule(moduleID)` **in addition to** (never instead of) the
  permission gate.
- If the route is legitimately unauthenticated or self-scoped (auth, `/users/me`,
  agent-key, SCIM, webhook, admin-realm, health), add it to `allowlistPrefixes` in
  `route_authz_coverage_test.go` **with a reason comment** — that is the only way to
  pass the coverage gate without a gate, and it forces the decision to be explicit.

### Enforce object-level (row) authorization

Permission gates answer "may this user do this *kind* of thing"; they do **not**
answer "may they touch *this* row". For that:

- Always scope repository reads/writes by `tenant_id` (every mutating query must
  carry `AND tenant_id = $n` — see `ScanRepository.Update`, AUTHZ-10). Do not trust
  an id from the URL to already be tenant-scoped.
- For non-admin data-scope narrowing, use `datascope.Enforcer` (inject it with
  `SetDataScope`): `AssertAsset`/`AssertFinding` for by-id paths (deny =
  `ErrNotFound`), `Filter`/`FilterFindings` for bulk ids, and `Resolve` + an
  SQL predicate from `postgres.dataScopeCond` for lists. New routes under
  `/assets/{id}` or `/findings/{id}` are guarded automatically. Add any new
  asset-bound list to the coverage table in *Data scope*.
- Never authorize a mutation off the request body's tenant/owner fields — derive the
  principal's tenant from the authenticated context (or, for agents, from the agent
  key), never from client-supplied data.
