EASM answers four questions about the internet-facing assets an organisation
owns or is responsible for:

1. **What do we have on the internet?** Discovery, starting from seeds.
2. **Is it really ours?** Attribution, with confidence and evidence.
3. **What is wrong with it?** Non-intrusive assessment.
4. **What changed?** Continuous monitoring.

The answers feed the existing CTEM registers (assets, exposures, findings) and
the P0–P3 priority engine. EASM adds no new score.

**Scope.** Only the customer's own attack surface, scanned under the customer's
authorization. Active scanning follows RFC-030 politeness and RFC-034 rules: the
scanner backs off when a target throttles or blocks it and never evades. A
third-party / vendor-risk mode is a separate owner decision (RFC-036 §7). If it
is ever built, it uses only passive public data.

            CTIS ingest (RFC-026) → assets, relationships, findings, exposure events
                                        ▼
            Observations (facet hashes) → diffs → state history, exposure events,
            notifications, workflow triggers → P0–P3 priority → ticketing, validation
```

**Why the split.** Sending packets to a target belongs on a sensor: the sensor
sits in a scan zone, follows the RFC-030 politeness limits, and has the egress
that RFC-034 controls. The API sends no traffic to customer infrastructure. It
only calls third-party data sources and DNS resolvers. This keeps the control
plane's IP reputation out of scanning and reuses the SSRF-guarded client every
API connector already uses (`pkg/httpsec`).

### UI

| Page | State |
|---|---|
| `/attack-surface` | Real, over `GET /attack-surface/stats`; the trend fields are hard-coded 0 in the API |
| `/attack-surface/external` | Partial: client-side over the first 100 assets; the "Expiring certs" card is always 0 |
| `/assets/{domains,certificates,ip-addresses,websites,services}` | Real lists over `/assets?types=`; certificates without `not_after` show as valid; websites without a status show 200 |
| `/assets/changes` (What changed) | Real |
| `/attack-paths`, `/exposure-chains`, `/exposures` | Real |
| `/exposures/{vulnerabilities,secrets,code,misconfigurations}` | Partial: side cards show tenant-wide numbers |
| `/scope-config`, `/scoping` | Real |

No EASM page is a `useDashboardStats` scaffold. The planned pages (§7) must
each have their own endpoint. The UI CI test `sidebar-no-scaffolds` enforces
this for the sidebar.

## 3. Seeds and authorization (planned)

A **seed** is a fact the tenant asserts about itself, and discovery starts from
it. Seed kinds: organisation name, brand, root domain, ASN, CIDR, cloud
account, GitHub organisation, mobile publisher, analytics or tag ID, favicon
hash. Seeds sit in Scoping › Boundaries next to targets and exclusions.

| Ownership proof | What it allows |
|---|---|
| None (asserted) | Passive collection; T1 active assessment of confirmed assets |
| DNS TXT (`verified_domains`, reused from SSO) or cloud connector | Auto-confirmation of names under the domain; eligible for T2 intrusive checks on opt-in |

Exclusions always win, as today. An asset is actively scanned only when it is
attributed `confirmed` and either inside a scope target or derived from a seed.
Candidates and dependencies get passive (T0) checks only.

## 4. Attribution

**Built (P0, migration 000324).** `asset_attributions` holds per asset a
state, a confidence 0–100 and the strongest rule; `easm_evidence` holds one row
per (asset, rule, source) with the technique, the source and the observed
datum. It is a side table, not columns on `assets`: the asset write paths each
list their columns, and a column one of them forgets is silently dropped. An
asset without a row is a legacy asset and counts as confirmed, so nothing in
the inventory changed meaning.

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Rules, noisy-OR, O4 decision, `Merge` (automation only raises; a human decision stands) | `pkg/domain/attribution` |
| Storage, tenant-scoped writes (a foreign asset id writes nothing) | `internal/infra/postgres/attribution_repository.go` |
| First producer: CT promotion (`fqdn_under_verified_root` 0.99 → confirmed; `fqdn_under_asserted_root` 0.85 → needs_review) | `internal/app/certmonitor/promote.go` |
| Scan gate: asset-group members that are not confirmed are skipped; a group of only unconfirmed assets is refused; a failed lookup stops the dispatch | `internal/app/scan/targets.go` (`WithAttributionGate`) |
| `GET /api/v1/assets/{id}/attribution` (assets:read) and `PUT` (assets:write, audited `asset.attribution_decided`) | `internal/infra/http/handler/asset_attribution_handler.go` |

**Asset merges** (dedup review, RFC-028) keep attribution: the kept asset
takes the most recent human decision of any merged asset (older decisions stay
in the audit log); without one it keeps its own record, and merged assets'
automatic records are dropped, never demoting a legacy asset. Evidence moves to
the kept asset, one row per (rule, source) with the earliest first sighting
(`mergeAttribution` in `internal/infra/postgres/asset_merge_plan.go`).

Deviation from the plan below, on the owner's instruction for P0 (feed CT
names into the asset pipeline, marked unconfirmed): names found under a domain
the tenant did not verify enter the inventory as `needs_review` assets rather
than as candidates outside it. The scan gate keeps them passive. P2's
`easm_candidates` is still where weak (< 50) names will live.

**Planned (P2).** Each candidate carries **evidence** rows (kind, source, observed value, weight,
time). Confidence is the noisy-OR of the evidence weights,
`1 − Π(1 − wᵢ)`, shown as 0–100. Weights start from a rule table (for example:
name under a verified root ≈ 0.99, IP in a seeded CIDR/ASN ≈ 0.9, resource
returned by the tenant's cloud connector = 1.0, TLS SAN shared with a confirmed
name ≈ 0.5, favicon hash match ≈ 0.4). Shared-hosting or CDN evidence counts
against the candidate and points to the `dependency` state.

States: `candidate` → `confirmed` | `rejected` | `dependency` (ours by name,
infrastructure is a provider's) | `monitor_only`. Only strong evidence classes
auto-confirm; everything else goes to the review queue. A rejection is kept as
a tombstone, so the same candidate is not proposed again unless a new kind of
evidence appears. Each rule's precision is learned per tenant from
confirm/reject decisions (a Beta prior per rule), and that adjusts its weight.

Candidates live outside the asset table. A confirmed candidate becomes an asset
through the normal ingest path, so there is still one asset-creation path (the
concern RFC-019 §6 raised). Assets created by tenant-triggered scans keep the
current behaviour and get evidence stamped on them.

## 4a. Overview API (built, P1)

`GET /api/v1/easm/summary` (assets:read, `attack_surface` module, data scope)
answers the overview in one call: surface assets by type (`domain`,
`subdomain`, `ip_address`, `certificate`) and internet-facing services;
attribution counts (legacy assets without a record count as confirmed and are
also reported separately) with the age of the oldest review item; assets first
seen in the last 7 and 30 days and since the latest CTEM cycle was activated
(absent when there is no cycle, never a misleading 0); open external exposures
by severity and type; the ten most severe open external exposures; and CT
monitoring freshness (`ct_monitor_state`). Code: `internal/app/easm`,
`internal/infra/postgres/easm_summary_repository.go`.

## 5. Data model (planned)

- **Graph.** Reuse `assets` + `asset_relationships`. Add asset types `asn` and
  `netblock`, and relationship types `announced_by` (IP/netblock → ASN),
  `serves_certificate` (service → certificate), `hosted_by` (asset →
  provider/CDN) and `cname_of` (emitted by DNS resolution). OWASP Amass' Open
  Asset Model is the reference vocabulary.
- **Observations.** Append-only per (asset, facet), where the facets are DNS
  record set, open ports, TLS certificate, HTTP fingerprint, technology set and
  WHOIS/RDAP. Each observation stores a canonical hash. A change of hash is a
  diff, and the diff writes state history and the matching exposure event.
- **Evidence.** `easm_evidence` keyed by tenant and subject (candidate or asset).
- **Time.** `first_seen`/`last_seen` per asset and per observation; the CT
  `not_before` and the passive-DNS first-seen give the earliest external
  evidence, which is what MTTD is measured against.

## 6. Known limits of what is built

- ~~The CT monitor queries only the first 50 domain assets per tenant.~~
  Fixed in RFC-036 P0: it watches domain assets, verified domains and domain
  scope targets, rotates through all of them (`ct_monitor_state`), retries
  crt.sh and falls back to Cert Spotter. See
  [certificate-transparency-monitoring.md](certificate-transparency-monitoring.md).
- ~~CT discoveries stay exposure events.~~ Fixed in RFC-036 P0: CT names
  become `subdomain` assets with attribution (§4).
- Sensor images ship no recon binaries. The recon executor is off by default
  but advertises recon capabilities when it is turned on. Pipeline steps do not
  feed one step's output into the next.
- httpx's favicon, JARM, ASN and certificate fields are parsed and dropped
  (`core.LiveHost` has no fields for them). No certificate asset comes from a
  live TLS handshake.
- Nothing sets asset scope `external` or `shadow` automatically, so the
  "Shadow IT" change view is empty.

## 7. UI (planned)

Discovery › Attack Surface becomes the EASM workspace. Tabs:

| Tab | Backed by |
|---|---|
| Overview | `GET /easm/summary`: attributed assets, review queue size, new in 7 days, exposures by severity, freshness, coverage |
| Inventory | `/assets` filtered to external, attribution columns |
| Review | `GET /easm/candidates` + evidence; confirm / reject / dependency / monitor only; bulk |
| Graph | `GET /easm/graph?root=` (seed → domain → subdomain → IP → service → certificate) |
| Changes | `/state-history/*` + facet diffs |
| Exposures | `/exposures?source=easm` and EASM findings |

Seeds are edited in Scoping › Boundaries.
