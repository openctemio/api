-- RFC-043 §6 (item 11): re-fingerprint runs, one row per tenant.
-- https://github.com/openctemio/openctem/blob/develop/api/docs/rfcs/RFC-043-deduplication-and-identity.md
--
-- The re-fingerprint job (cmd/refingerprint) re-keys a tenant's version-1
-- findings to the current identity recipe in batches. The row is its
-- checkpoint: cursor is the last finding id done, so an interrupted run
-- resumes where it stopped, and a finished run is a no-op (findings already
-- on the target version are skipped). While an applying run is in progress,
-- scan auto-resolve is paused for the tenant (decision D11): a finding whose
-- old key a scan did not produce must not be closed as fixed.
