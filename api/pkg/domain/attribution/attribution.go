// Package attribution decides whether an internet-facing asset belongs to the
// tenant, from typed evidence (RFC-036 §6.4, owner decision O4).
//
// Confidence is the noisy-OR of the positive evidence weights, discounted by
// the negative ones: c = (1 − Π(1 − w⁺)) · Π(1 − w⁻), shown as 0–100. An asset
// is auto-confirmed only when at least one strong rule fired and c ≥ 90;
// otherwise it waits for review (c ≥ 50) or stays a candidate.
//
// An asset with no attribution record is a legacy asset and counts as
// confirmed: everything in the inventory before EASM was put there by the
// tenant, a scan it ran, or an integration it connected.
