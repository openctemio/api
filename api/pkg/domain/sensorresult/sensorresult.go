// Package sensorresult is the domain of sensor results that no command
// stands behind (RFC-040 §5.3, owner decision Q6 (a),
// docs/rfcs/RFC-040-platform-sensor-mutual-distrust.md): the tenant's policy
// for them and the quarantine where they wait for a person to accept or
// discard them.
//
// A sensor report is "bound" when it names a command assigned to the
// submitting sensor and still open; it then behaves as before. A report
// without one is "unsolicited". Collector and CI runner sensors exist to push
// unsolicited results, so theirs are applied with limits (existing assets and
// human-resolved findings are left alone). Any other sensor's unsolicited
// report is quarantined when the tenant's mode is "quarantine", and applied
// with the same limits, plus an audit entry and a metric, when it is "warn".
