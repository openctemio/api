package sensor

// The heartbeat doorbell (RFC-023 §9.2a): the heartbeat response tells a
// sensor THAT something is waiting for it, never WHAT. Jobs are still fetched
// and claimed through the command poll, so authorization, the zone claim
// predicate and claim semantics stay in one place.

// Action is a typed control directive the platform can ring on the heartbeat
// (RFC-023 §10.2 K1). The set is closed: a sensor must ignore a value it does
// not know, and there is no free-form or shell verb (RFC-023 §10.4 R-4).
