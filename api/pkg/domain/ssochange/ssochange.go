// Package ssochange models an organization SSO change that a platform
// administrator submitted and that waits for an owner of the organization to
// approve it (RFC-022, owner decision 2026-10-02).
//
// The organization's SAML configuration and OIDC identity providers decide who
// can sign in to it. A platform administrator who could change them directly
// could install their own IdP signing certificate or OIDC client and sign in as
// any member, so the admin console only proposes such a change; an owner
// applies it.
